On the other hand, Food waste contributes 8 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country, it would come in third after the United States and China in terms of impact on global warming. \n\nSharing food with other students would reduce wastage and help the environment while also helping students in need.\n\nThus, we have FoodShare. FoodShare is an application that allows people to share surplus food with other students who are in need.

Our online software will update the students regarding whether their instructor is present in their office, saving the students both time and energy.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/667","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jYDIykeNs2M\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"jYDIykeNs2M","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"pk","name":"Pakistan","nameNative":"Pakistan"},"users":[{"id":2162,"name":"immad amir","country":"Pakistan"},{"id":2163,"name":"Talha Yaseen","country":"Pakistan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1984,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 11:43:38"},{"id":813,"title":"automatic timetable generator","description":"The application implements machine learning, that allows to automatically generate accurate and efficient time tables for classes which saves up on a lot of resources as well as being error free.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/813","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qpdy20ERqB8\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"qpdy20ERqB8","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"pk","name":"Pakistan","nameNative":"Pakistan"},"users":[{"id":2348,"name":"Saif Syed","country":"Pakistan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 19:06:25"},{"id":229,"title":"Red Bull Basement \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430","description":"\u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0439","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/229","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9zG19NK6sVo\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"9zG19NK6sVo","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1561,"name":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":5,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/17 11:20:07"},{"id":216,"title":"Ami - Your Personal Health Assistant","description":"A personal health assistant that will monitor the user\u0027s medical history and the AI Neural Network will monitor the person\u0027s health and suggest them the best possible lifestyle routines like exercises and things to be done and not done to stay healthy and fit.

Therefore from this invention we can develop green energy infrastructure for the traffic systems. This involves storing the produced energy in daylight when traffic movements are at the peaks, therefore the energy stored during daytime can be released into the street lights at night, according to our calculation 10 KW of stored energy from an small area of road can be enough to power up 40 street lights. The produced energy can also be used to supply power to charging stations for electric vehicles!, as some developing countries cannot afford to install charging stations because they cannot afford to produce enough electricity from  power plants, therefore there are no electric vehicles on road , which causes rise of pollution levels, which has affected cities like Delhi , Shanghai, Beijing , by using our device people will start purchasing electric vehicles as the electricity used for charging wont be expensive and therefore will decrease the pollution levels to a great extent.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1250","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mBtajWCSPk0\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"mBtajWCSPk0","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":61250,"name":"Nisha Singh","country":"India"},{"id":61251,"name":"Rahul Singh","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/27 21:08:03"},{"id":1542,"title":"Virtual Exposure Therapy","description":"V.E.T is a revolutionary VR platform that makes it possible for patients to take the therapy directly at the comfort of their homes.

This is usually solved by creating a website or an app or a messaging group. But these often distract us and end up consuming more time than necessary, thus hindering our productivity. \nTo tackle this situation we have come up with a platform called \u201cFaction\u201d, which lets us create productivity-focused groups. What makes us different is that we provide a wide variety of UI options and features that an admin can use to customize the group as he sees fit. The admin can select the required features from a vast array of available ones. The features include Seasonal \u0026 Club oriented themes, Events, Time tables, Query \u0026 Upvoting, Lost \u0026 Found, Sub-groups, Reminders and much more. \nAssume that an admin in a football club wants to create a group to manage activities, matches and keep the players informed. All he has to do is register and attain the link to create his own custom application. He can add features such as calendars, event tabs, upvote system and so on. \nNow let us take a completely different situation. Say a university wants to create a site regarding its tech fest, which is to be conducted in a month. Instead of creating a website\/app from scratch, it can create a group consisting of various event details, all the participants can simply join the group to receive details. Features like countdown timer can be used to creatively display time left for the fest. In the end, it\u2019s completely up to the admin, to decide on how to use the group and thus ensure helping its members.\nTo sum it up, the platform is an essential tool for both students and any other person seeking to create a group as it supports a wide variety of environments such as clubs, universities, offices, social or live events and so on. This application can become their daily productivity app with all the features they\u2019ll need.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1629","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RM2m9ewZGrE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"RM2m9ewZGrE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":106593,"name":"S.kanishq Sunil","country":"India"},{"id":106594,"name":"Rakesh M","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":23,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 21:35:43"},{"id":1307,"title":"Mondokoro","description":"Attendance management system is converted into electronic formats using an applications software.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1307","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HPcgdULvCq8\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"HPcgdULvCq8","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"jp","name":"Japan","nameNative":"\u65e5\u672c"},"users":[{"id":69204,"name":"Otoya Kaiga","country":"Japan"},{"id":69205,"name":"Ryo Hiraga","country":"Japan"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":11,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 09:50:26"},{"id":1213,"title":"Automated Taxi System (ATS)","description":"Our idea is about to run automated cars in campus.

The nearest car to the pickup point will come for pickup (if available). The car will take them to their destination by shortest possible path. We can use GPS system and can use google maps system to get the shortest path and also to get the position of cars. Also, we can use different sensors (like IR sensor) for the successful movement of car. We can also add a FARE system according to time of journey, the time will start after pickup and will end after the completion of journey. Any passenger can end his\/her trip before destination, the gates will open only after payment. Also, there will be camera system in the car for the security surveillance and for the protection of system.\nFor the power of cars, we can use solar system.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1213","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BUQ4wj6EnWs\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"BUQ4wj6EnWs","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":55026,"name":"Rohan Goyal","country":"India"},{"id":55027,"name":"Arpit Mangal","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":36,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/27 15:02:47"},{"id":574,"title":"OPUS","description":"Opus is a digital platform aiming to gather students together for studying in the campus.

This also makes it so much easier to know who to contact when you have any homework or assignment questions because you know exactly who is in that class.\n\nBut the main feature of the ConnectUL service will be the option to create different groups. Create one group with your housemates, one with your friends and another one for an assignment group. The app will synchronize the timetables of all group members and create an overview showing when everyone is free to hang out, meet up or work on a project.\n\nScheduling meet ups will be made even easier as the web app will allow you to synchronize your timetable with your google or icloud calendar so that you have all your appointments, meetings and classes in one place on all your devices.

The internet has made it easier for a lot of students to obtain books or notes relevant to their studies but not everyone prefers using electronic media to study. Trace book is an app that will make it easier and less costly for students to get the books they require. Every college\/university has a library and the app will keep a record of the all the books present in the library\u2019s inventory. Students will be able to view the books and then check whether the book they need is available or not. Those students who have passed their respective courses can put their books up for sale so that students who need them can buy the books at a much better price.

Lectures are simply not enough for a student and self study is an important part of every student\u0027s strategy for success. When it comes to studying, according to the research conducted by Pupils Point about 95% students prefer studying in groups and more surprisingly, 49.8% are comfortable with the idea of studying with people who they are not even familiar with, as long as they would study the same subject, they\u2019re good to go. \n\nThat\u0027s why we are set to sail to students rescue. Pupil\u0027s Point is an app designed to help students coordinate their meetings and find people with the same aim as many other students. All they need to do is they simply need to sign up with their college ID, the app will ask for their GPS location and institues email address once the person signs in to Pupil\u0027s Point they will be able to see all the points set up within their campus\/institute. If there\u0027s an algebra quiz in a few hours and they want to prepare for it, through our app students can see if someone has set up a point for it\u0027s preparation and join it.\n\nStudents\/teachers can create their own point by simply clicking on the \u0022Create a Point\u0022 tab, and click create. They can create one as a student and as a mentor. And if they do decide to mentor and take responsibility of the point, they can select to do so voluntarily or for incentives, an option where you can bid your price be it anything from food to money. If the mentor receives ratings above or equal to 3.5 their incentives can include money . The creator of the point can choose to keep the point private or visible to public. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to join a public point they can simply opt for a private point through our \u0022Search a Point\u0022 feature. Each Point will be given a unique ID they will be able to find private points they\u0027re looking for by simply searching for that ID , private points can\u2019t be joined by anyone until allowed to do so by the creator. \n\nThe \u0022My Points\u0022 tab will keep track of all the points the students\/mentors will be a part of to ensure they know what activities they\u0027re  entangled in. \n\nAs not all students would stay in peace or take the flow seriously which surely can ruin their experience. Therefore, after every Point session, the members will be able to give the session a rating that will be available for everyone to see. Ratings would be take for the serious attitude of the point, how good the mentor was. Apart from rating an attendance would be taken and if any member is marked absent for 3 classes they\u0027ll eventually be excluded from the point. Through this, new students can easily look up for Points with good reputation and weed out the bad ones. \n\nOur aim with this is to create a sustainable ecosystem and generate employment wherever we operate in.  And that\u0027s all it takes. Now the point is visible to all the students on campus and anyone who is interested can join in. \n\nIf the students are too drained to carry on with their studies and they just need to loosen up a little, then we\u2019ve got an option for them Pupil\u0027s point can find them many people to unwind with. Whatever they\u0027re willing to do, Pupil\u0027s Point will help them create a community specifically for it. \n\nThis app is not just a source of knowledge for the students but it\u2019s also a source of employment, allowing many students to showcase their ability to teach. \n\nA place with better opportunities and advancements.

The restaurant confirms the contents with the tablet put in the store. At the same time, the contents of the delivery are transmitted online to the student delivery person, and when the time comes, the delivery person delivers the food to the ordered student.\nWith Wasedeli, students do not need to line up in a long canteen, and can receive food ordered on their smartphones in advance of their lunch break.\n\n\u3010\u30ef\u30bb\u30c7\u30ea\u3068\u306f\uff1f\u3011\n\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u98df\u5802\u3084\u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb\u306f\u663c\u6642\u5927\u5909\u6df7\u307f\u5408\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u663c\u6642\u306f\u5927\u5b66\u5468\u56f2\u306e\u98f2\u98df\u5e97\u306b\u3082\u9577\u3044\u5217\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u77ed\u3044\u663c\u4f11\u307f\u3067\u306f\u5916\u306e\u98f2\u98df\u5e97\u306b\u98df\u3079\u306b\u884c\u304f\u3068\u6b21\u306e\u6388\u696d\u306b\u9045\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3068\u3044\u3046\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u305d\u3053\u3067\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u30ef\u30bb\u30c7\u30ea\u3092\u958b\u767a\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u30ef\u30bb\u30c7\u30ea(Wasedeli)\u306f\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u306b\u7279\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30d5\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30ea\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u5b66\u751f\u304c\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u304b\u3089\u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u9078\u3093\u3067\u6ce8\u6587\u3002\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u5074\u306f\u305d\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u3092\u5e97\u8217\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3059\u308b\u30bf\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\u3002\u540c\u6642\u306b\u914d\u9054\u5185\u5bb9\u304c\u5b66\u751f\u914d\u9054\u54e1\u306b\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u4f1d\u9054\u3055\u308c\u3001\u6642\u9593\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u914d\u9054\u54e1\u304c\u6ce8\u6587\u3057\u305f\u5b66\u751f\u306b\u6599\u7406\u3092\u914d\u9054\u3059\u308b\u3002\n\u30ef\u30bb\u30c7\u30ea\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u306f\u98df\u5802\u306e\u9577\u3044\u5217\u306b\u4e26\u3076\u5fc5\u8981\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3001\u307e\u305f\u3001\u663c\u4f11\u307f\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3059\u3050\u4e8b\u524d\u306b\u30b9\u30de\u30db\u3067\u6ce8\u6587\u3057\u305f\u6599\u7406\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u53d6\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u3088\u308a\u8a73\u7d30\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u306f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u3092\u53c2\u7167\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff01\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1Rl7pKRZR7R30qgEMqmh9DJK3HOiifcvR3G8G4WIrktI\/edit?usp=sharing","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1296","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_FXLLsNjNU8\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"_FXLLsNjNU8","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"jp","name":"Japan","nameNative":"\u65e5\u672c"},"users":[{"id":68605,"name":"Seita Miyamoto","country":"Japan"},{"id":68606,"name":"Sho Sugita","country":"Japan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":13,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 09:14:34"},{"id":231,"title":"Helpika (helping hands for teachers)","description":"We built app Helpika it has over 1480 active teachers and 4800 downloads. it is a student analysis tool for teachers.

Their talent gets wasted because they do not get a chance or a platform to showcase it.\nSecondly, a college\/university should have a culture of its own, but there is no platform do to so in most of these places.\n\nDue to these reasons, the necessity of college radio kicks in. A college radio can provide a platform to all these students and build overall unity for students of the college. \nBut setting up a physical radio station is very costly and a headache. To tackle this problem, we can take advantage of the internet to build an online radio station. But still, even setting up an online station isn\u0027t really that easy. So our aim is to provide such a platform that can create and host customizable radio stations according to the college needs. Setting up, hosting, scheduling, everything would be possible in a few clicks and would be as easy as a pie. \n\nNow, the online station is set up, hosted, customized according to the needs of the college (show scheduling, UI, etc.), secure, the only problem that arises is, students won\u0027t always get the time to look after and host the shows (like music shows, confession shows, etc). We have found a fix for that, and it is \u0022Artificial intelligence-based radio jockey\u0022, that can automatically play music that would be best suited, speak frequently to make things more lively, provide regular news updates, attend live phone calls (alpha feature) and much more. \n\nModern College Radios could bring a revolution. All the energy and talent of students could be used in a much more fruitful way. This project is a take at popularizing the concept of college radios and how it can benefit the overall development and personality of students and inspire other students to do the same.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/112","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C6v2FkXcCQU\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"C6v2FkXcCQU","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":1005,"name":"Utkarsh Mishra","country":"India"},{"id":1006,"name":"Mankaran Singh","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":65,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/08 08:07:16"},{"id":743,"title":"Green Walls","description":"Growing of plants on walls for making places prettier and more ecological clean.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/743","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wvRVmumG5yY\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"wvRVmumG5yY","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ru","name":"Russian Federation","nameNative":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f"},"users":[{"id":2259,"name":"Vasily Santalov","country":"Russian Federation"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":5,"name":"global.videotag.sanitation","xivado_tag_id":"#Sanitation"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 17:16:45"},{"id":561,"title":"turn to the rector","description":"Over university is very big, that\u2019s why we already have turn to the rector.

In order to live a better university life, there are places where facilities are more than enough depending on the university where enhancement of facilities is important.  But our university doesn\u0027t have much.  A site that answers the needs of such university students.  Summary Major chain stores are now entering universities, but most of them are limited to universities with many students.  A university known for its private and prestigious names.  Because it doesn\u0027t fail.  The company wants to expand the scale of its own store where it wants to have a high success rate.  However, it is not easy to open stores at various universities.  Because there is a risk of failure.  The university wants to improve its facilities, but if there are few students or it is a public university, there is no money and it cannot be improved.  On the student side, they want a comfortable environment where they can spend their free time and spend their morning, noon, and evening meals at university.I want to create a site that can meet the needs of these three parties.  Any company companies, including that the site wants to put a store in the university, also put universities that are registered in the (appropriate company in University), the site that can be seen this site in what the companies  ing.  At university, take questionnaires to as many students as possible.  If possible, all students.  1 to 10 what you want at the university.  The university will take the statistics and list the top 10 facilities that students at their university want.  Companies can see what college students want from what they see.  Knowing that, the company can reduce the possibility of failure as much as possible.  And the most important point of this site is to be able to raise funds from students and to reduce personnel to some extentWe would like to set up a store in this university that will be able to meet the needs of this university for funding companies to see this site.  However, there is not enough funds.  Can be recruited from the university side.  (However, 70% of the funds can be raised by the student as long as the remaining 30% can be raised from the student side.) Students can provide funds from 1 yen per person.  For example, human resources are needed to operate a human resource reduction shop on the side of a company established under the agreement of the university manager and the company that returns in accordance with the amount of funds.  The company will create a new store, so it needs personnel.  Introducing an empty frame byte system using empty frames in university classes Soliciting students who want to work there, you can use the student empty frames (you can make a shift that prioritizes balance with study)A site where you can use your free frames to make a part-time job (a shift that gives priority to balance between study) and connect companies and universities. If you make this, you can make your university better with your own hands.  Reduce the risk of failure to reduce human resources to some extent Reduce the risk of failure on the student side Enrich the university side facilities that can make use of free space to increase student satisfaction  (Provided that there is a possibility that it cannot be done while still in school. The facility can only be expanded within the land owned by the university. Possibility that funds will not be collected.)","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1017","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/frgAPyhjm94\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"frgAPyhjm94","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"jp","name":"Japan","nameNative":"\u65e5\u672c"},"users":[{"id":28668,"name":"m y","country":"Japan"},{"id":28669,"name":"TEPPEI KASADA","country":"Japan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":5,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/25 03:45:13"},{"id":1306,"title":"miniRabits","description":"Establishing good habits and sticking to them is a real challenge.

Using inbuilt AQI sensors it monitors air quality of the surroundings 24\/7 and sends that data to a smartphone application via Bluetooth connection. The data is further pushed to the cloud for Machine Learning processing. This crowd sourced air quality data from all active devices is used to implement a bunch of features for the patients (Healthy Route, Pollution forecast, Live pollution) and can also be used by government and organizations fighting against air pollution to plan and find air pollution sources.\nCaeli also comes with a palm size drug nebulizer which can be directly connected to the mask by the user to take medication whenever required. The drug nebulizer is built on silent mesh technology and patients can schedule their medicine timings directly from the caeli app for automatic drug delivery.\n\nOur team lives in Delhi, which is among the Top 3 poorest air quality cities in the world.

We only use high quality ingredients and are fully meat-free.\nWe also changed up the conventional delivery system. First of all we\u2019re a pure delivery service meaning we don\u2019t need service staff or expensive, central locations. Customers have to preorder their bowl up until 10pm the day before. This allows us to collect all the orders for the following day and just order the amount of fresh food needed from our suppliers \u2013 this is good for food waste reduction and cost-cutting. We only offer one bowl a day in order to facilitate scaling. Lastly we just deliver in batches and our customers can pick up their order in a certain timeframe. Our product combined with our low-cost delivery concept allows us to offer outstanding products and service at a very reasonable price.

Having embarked on the implementation of our initiative, we have developed a simple system of obtaining discounts:\n1. The student receives a card for free;\n2- Shows a card at SE where they can get a discount;\n3- Get a discount.\nAt the very beginning of our project, students saved about 1,000 rubles per a month. My friend and I spent 0 rubles on creating a project!\nSix months passed, we launched an improved card design and created a web-site profkarta.com We increased the amount of our partners and then students began to save more than 2000 rubles per a month.\n4 months ago, we were supported by one of the leading banks in the country - Ak Bars Bank. They helped us digitize the project in order to create a card payment system. Thanks to this, we have integrated a cashback into the system. Now students receive 10% cashback for expenses on public transport, cafes, fast food, taxis and cinema. Now 10,000 of our students save up to 5,000 rubles a month, they still get cards for FREE\nHowever, now we want to fully digitalize our discount system in order to make it as convenient as possible for students, this will help create a whole system for them, which will help them save even a large amount per month and be completely immersed in the educational and extracurricular process.\nOur idea\nIn addition to digitizing \u0022Profkarta\u0022, we want to include in the mobile application 2 more directions - banking and students\nBanking is a complete banking system of payments, transfers and deposits for students.\nThe \u201cStudent Initiatives\u201d section implies the digitalization of some areas of the student body, such as the AR Buildings Guide, library, online posters, schedules and homework, push notifications for students. In addition to the basic digitization, we also want to launch special challenges for students that will cultivate the positive habits that are ecological, wellness and increase student\u0027s personal productivity. \nAn example of such a challenge is the delivery of plastic bottles for recycling, waking up before 7 a.m. or reading 50 pages of a book daily. By fulfilling these the student will receive special points that can be exchanged for various bonuses. \nYou can watch our mini-project of structure of mobile app on https:\/\/ibb.co\/4ZdgVCY\nOur goal is to help students feel themselves special and make them understand that we also care about them. We are just a students, but we try to go ahead and create projects that make our life a little better. But we are not omnipotent, we also need constant support in order for our idea to be appreciated and helped to develop it together with us. Therefore, we hope that we will be supported this time, and again we will do everything we can!\nand we don\u2019t have a single mobile application at the university\u2026","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/915","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/f3xPBD2kid4\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"f3xPBD2kid4","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ru","name":"Russian Federation","nameNative":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f"},"users":[{"id":2510,"name":"Daniil Sigal","country":"Russian Federation"},{"id":2511,"name":"Ilnur K\u0027Hazipov","country":"Russian Federation"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":538,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 21:47:16"},{"id":434,"title":"Ifnmu idea","description":"my idea is to create interactive lectures and assignments","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/434","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xVz6892FZio\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"xVz6892FZio","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1861,"name":"\u041a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 16:06:49"},{"id":1374,"title":"Anti-Drunk-Driving Safety System","description":"Prevents the vehicle from starting if the person is drunk.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1374","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/c6FxD7xD6AE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"c6FxD7xD6AE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":73355,"name":"Harshit Baranwal","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 12:47:56"},{"id":1655,"title":"Ciber Hug","description":"Hug everyone.

The app is called Walk with me. Its purpose to act as a guardian angel for students who feel unsafe when traveling alone, especially during night times. So how it works is that it will have a variety of safety features that are designed to ensure that the student is safe.\nThe app will have a few key features of security which are mentioned below and more could be added later.\n\nThe first feature - Safty zone:\nThis feature allows students to access a map of their surrounding area, with safety zones marked out (roads that have campus security huts in their route). When the student enters their destination the app will plan out the safest route for them to take which has the most cameras and on-duty guards along the path.\n\nSecond feature - Guardian angel :\nHow this works is that upon activation, the app will send the student 10-15mins messages asking them if their okay and still on route to where they\u0027re going. If the student doesn\u0027t respond within a given timelimit the app will alert guards nearest to the last seen location of the students a message for them to check out the area to see if anything suspicious is happening so that they can call the polices. This feature is not only limited to on-campus it could also be adapted for areas out-side campus like when students go out for fun. The student can also activate the app by setting a time delay before they go out, for the app to check up on them after their night is done, to ensure their home safe- like a guardian angel. \nLast feature- Walk buddies: \nThe app could also support a platform for students living in the same residences a walking buddy system, where students who tend to stay late on campus due to sports or other academic activities, can organize a walk-time which allows them to walk in larger groups rather than alone. Though this is not limiting to walking, it could also be adapted to sharing an uber ride home when it is too late to walk saving the student a bit of money while having someone else there with them to provide a sense of comfort.\nThe app could have more features added on as its developed, like a panic button that will send polices your locations immediately when you press it, which could be added to your home screen for easy access. \n\nThis app is designed for the safety of students in and around campus. This is a bit of an ambitious project. However, I do believe that with a little guidance and access to some resources, we can make varsities around the world a bit safer.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1553","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XZ8VkcfJqSc\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"XZ8VkcfJqSc","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":96738,"name":"Phemelo Maile","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":12,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 19:01:02"},{"id":1382,"title":"I drive you","description":"Hello, we are Beltr\u00e1n and Felipe and we are looking for a solution to all the problems we have about student transportation.

Yonke is for clients and YonkeBiz is for our partners. Clients can book for an appointment or order products through our app to salon owners and suppliers respectively. Owing to our platform, clients no longer have to queue for long in salons compared to prior. Yonke benefits clients as they can compare prices from various salons and suppliers, get discount through our Yonke Rewards and get latest specials. We offer lower prices because we deal will manufactures directly and have no overhead costs.\n\nOur suppliers are partly students who sell beauty products on campus and surrounding wholesalers. Our aim and mission is to make it easy, affordable and time convenient for our partners to reach out to clients. Through our sophisticated rating systems and marketing tools we expect our partners to see an increase in their client base. Our partners sell and advertise their business on our platform for free.\n\nYonke intends to employ students to deliver products on our designated checkpoints on campus. These students must be from disadvantaged background who are in need of financial aid. Our delivery system is convenient as we will be delivering anytime of the day and on campus where it is safe. With our care for the environment we use non-transparent eco packages to package our orders.

If you don\u0027t sign in you won\u0027t get a meal. Unless the kitchen makes an exception, in which this action affects the budget laid out.\n\nThis is residence driven by student leadership and initiative. Thus I made the SonopApp to fix this problem. This project will allow students to sign in on the app from anywhere on any browser, as well as regularly receive emails as reminders to sign in. The project has 2 sides. One is for the students and the other for the kitchen management.\n\nOn the student side a student can sign up or log in with his\/her student number, get a weekly schedule from the house committee and sign in for the meal he\/she wants. On the kitchen side, they can manage and verify accounts to prevent fake accounts (a university student makes those), because for every account a meal has to be prepared. They can view a list of all the students that signed in as well as export the list to a CSV format for printing.\n\nThis project has been running since October 2018! It has 150 users daily during the semesters.\n\nThis project can be adapted and personalized for any residence or university in South Africa. It can be extended to be used in any organisation with a food bank. This is an app that can make an impact on the world.

wired to love learning as it is in the pleasure centre of the brain.\nMost people are not actually wired to learn that well through just reading and writing (or typing in today\u0027s world) but at the end of the rainbow (of learning) lies a pot of gold that we all want... knowledge.\nThe best way to understand this is Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (levels of education)\nWe learn best through experiencing and being able to fail.\nWe are told to trust the process, but what about enjoying the process?\nThere is currently a saturated market in educational apps, and many AAA games are not tailored to for learning (and good luck trying to become the next Capcom).\nAAA games are generally seen just for fun and on the other hand educational games can get a tad boring (be honest).\nThough in AAA games, the learnings are not recognized at an academic level, although we already know you learn best from these types of video games.\n\nSo, what is the solution?\n#theEducationPatch;\n\nTHE AIM: of The Education Patch as (an MVP)\nIs to bridge this gap between AAA games and education by\n\u2022\tResearching what elements in pre-existing games and back catalogues (we can backdate) find accurate information like history (for example) in theses video games and then have a test on a website.\n\u2022\tHave the user record themselves on camera as they log in their answers (as security).\n\u2022\tWe would then award a \u201cdigital award\u201d in Video Game Learning in the field when achieved.\n\nThe first steps:\n\u2022\tWould be to gauge interest by doing a Survey Monkey and talk to experts like Nvidia for feedback.\n\u2022\tAlso, do some social media marketing to create awareness of our digital product or on gaming platforms like Steam or Discord.\n\u2022\tThen test the interest level again.\n\u2022\tMake a website gamer-students can log into to do their game test, users browse for their games to see what learnings can be tested. This can be across many games and genres (and will grow our database over time), history, for example, learned throughout various games. Level 1 video game-based learnings (History). This is something users would be able to do after playing a game, \u201cI wonder what real learnings was in that game?\u201d for example, Assassins Creed. Some of that history about the American civil war was accurate (this also tells the users what wasn\u2019t true or likely to be true due to it not being on the test).\n\u2022\tThese tests can be sat unlimited times\n\u2022\tSome games will have more academic learnings, other games less so. It might not be enough in one game to get to level1 also the learnings will be at different levels.\n\u2022\tSo, playing several games and them being verified as having the game patch will lead to the first level of the history award being unlocked (in this case).\n\nThe technology involved:\n\u2022\tAt the beginning would be a website and the user would use their computer\/tablet\/phone camera to record themselves doing the test to prove it was them that sat the test (as security) also our patch would eventually be needed to prove that the player actually played the game.\n\u2022\tThen later use Blockchain to store unchangeable records of the gamer student\u2019s academic gaming achievements.\n\u2022\tLater on, an Education patch could plug straight into the game (optional plug-in) and the tests could be done to progress to the next level for example or even have an icon display (in gameplay).\n\u2022\tThat a Learning was happening (this is real knowledge) with the Education patch symbol activated.\n\nSo why is this the perfect time?\n\u2022\tRight now, unfortunately, there is a lot of stigma about games being just a waste of time and only being violent.\n\u2022\tBoth the gaming industry would jump on this opportunity to having gaming seen in a more positive light.\n\u2022\tThe education systems around the world in Ed-Tech are always looking at new ways to engage students in this new High-tech world, where it has been proven by many educational specialists\u0027 game-based learning might actually be the best way to learn (ever).\n\u2022\t Later pitching this to the gaming companies to \u201cadd value\u201d to their games by having this new startup manage this #EducationPatch on their behalf (but also not burden them). The main goal would be gaming companies would work together with us to add educational elements to games as an optional extra (a patch) to enhance our educational patch even more.\n\n\u201cImagine playing a video game, like Cyberpunk 2077 and you have to code a door to get entrance into an enemy HQ. We have just activated #theEducationalPatch; you might have to learn some real coding to unlock that door, it takes a bit longer to get that door open, but you gain some actual coding knowledge how exciting would that be? And then you can put those learnings towards accumulated learnings in other games and other levels towards your EducationPatch coding award. We envision @Digital Vision a world where the classroom and the videogame have merged creating what we like to call the gamer-student.\u201d\n\nMichael Spicer CEO\u0026Founder of Digital Vision AKA MyCool-Enterprises","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/943","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/823516595_640x360.jpg?r=pad","youtube_video_id":null,"vimeo_video_id":"367231069","country":{"code":"nz","name":"New Zealand","nameNative":"New Zealand"},"users":[{"id":1164,"name":"Michael Spicer","country":"New Zealand"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/22 11:25:59"},{"id":830,"title":"Clear","description":"Hello there.

I\u2019m Andrew and I\u2019m a student\u2026\n\nIn this video I\u2019d like to talk about the modern universities\u2019 problems. So, let\u2019s get right into it!\n\nProblem number one\n\nThis is parking lot.\n\nI get that not all the students can afford a car, but the problem of filled parking lots is still present. So, how can we fix it?\n\nRestricted entry is the solution - only students will be able to park there, and as for the staff, they\u2019ll have their own parking lot as well.\n\nProblem number 2\n\nCloakroom.\n\nIn our university, the queues to the cloakroom sometimes stretch out so far that they reach the city\u2019s outskirts, even though the university itself is at the center of the city. Sadly, we can\u2019t get rid of the queues completely, but we can at least get them to stay in the university\u2019s boundaries, we just need to implement\n\nThe automated cloakroom\n\nAnd for you not to be concerned with your clothes being stolen, there will be special garment bags, equipped with an electronic lock, which can only be opened by you.\n\nProblem number 3\n\nAnd queues\u2026 Once again. But this time it\u2019s a queue to the canteen.\n\nYou know how to solve it?\n\nA display, via which you will be able to order food and pay for it. Then the machine will give you a receipt with a number of your order on it, and then you will just to wait for your order to be complete and grab it on the counter.\n\nI\u2019ve already seen it somewhere, haven\u2019t I?\n\nProblem number 4\n\nLate attendance, absence at a class, sick-vouchers. In a nutshell it is this \u2013\n\nFilling out a roll book is rather tiresome activity. Why don\u2019t we make it digital? Students would be able to check in the roll book by themselves.\n\nBut the main question is \u2013 How?\n\nYes, every student has a student ID. And it\u2019ll help students to get to parking lot, enter the university, check in their coats, check in the roll book and even buy food with it, just by putting on the scanner.\n\nBut what if one loses their student ID?

What about you? \nI think that one of main purposes of universities is to teach students how to learn, because educational programs does not contain EVERY subject in it, thus students have to study something by themselves. \nTry to remember. Have your lecturers ever told you anything about methods of self-education? Were you told about time management, mind maps or anything similar? \n No, there is no such a thing in most of universities. \n This problem should be solved because today\u2019s student is tomorrow\u2019s graduate and worker, so he or she needs these skills in order to be efficient worker. \n Making a skilled specialist out of student \u2013 this is what universities are aiming for. I suggest including something in educational process that will help speed up this process. Are you with me? \n In order to solve this problem, one require a platform for remote education and online education. \n There will be a lot of useful stuff, such as: videos with trainings for students and teachers, webinars and consultations with teachers and invited HR\u2019s or workers, polls for students about their desires in study, games for improving different skills and so on. \n The most important thing is that on this platform both students and teachers are able to connect with employers so that they can adapt their educational programs in order to correspond with each other\u2019s needs. And of course, this will be for free. \n In prospect one will launch a full remote university education on this platform.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/581","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XyI4TTbUznU\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"XyI4TTbUznU","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ru","name":"Russian Federation","nameNative":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f"},"users":[{"id":2039,"name":"Rettlam \u0414\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430","country":"Russian Federation"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":10,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 21:53:10"},{"id":1210,"title":"Friendly Board","description":"Nuestro proyecto va en escanear, leer, traducir y proyectar.\n\nEste consiste en un tipo de proyector, pero que en diferencia de estar conectado a un computador, este se encarga de escanear la pizarra de clases, para luego procesar lo que dice, traducirlo, y proyectar su resultado en otra pizarra.\n\nUno de los factores que m\u00e1s afecta al irse de intercambio, es el idioma, ya que este crea un estado de miedo en estudiantes al salir de su zona de confort.

Ninety-five percent of college counseling center. Directors surveyed said the number of students with significant psychological problems is a growing concern on campus, according to the latest Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors survey of counseling center directors. Seventy percent of directors believe that the number of students with severe psychological problems on their campus has increased in the past year.\n\nSeveral college students experience friendship, hate, love, confusion, self doubt, social pressure, anxiety etc. On a daily basis in the lifestyle they live. It is high time we address or bring into focus the state of mind of college students which is a growing concern.\n\nIn order to help college students cope with such strong emotions or feelings, we have come up with the idea of a \u0022Red Bull Venting Machine\u0022. The idea is based on \u0022Vend for Vent\u0027.\n\nThe working of the vending machine is very convenient and easy to use for all students as our generation is quite technologically advance.\n\nSteps to follow:-\n1.In the Venting machine,press the number 1 or 2. 1 is for only buying the Red Bull can and 2 is for  Venting or to send a message to another person in the same college anonymously along with buying the Red Bull.\n\n2.If the student presses 1, he is energized and refreshed for the whole day by the consumption of the energy drink Red Bull.

When students arrive in an international university, they experience problems for a long time with communication in the country where they study! And I have the solution for this: The idea is for International University Students to learn the university\u0027s local language and be able to adapt quickly to the hosting environment. To do this, a local student, for example a Russian student in a Russian university can become language partner with a German student. They can engage in a continuous communication method in which they have meetings so that the German student learns the Russian language and the Russian student practices his or her English. In this way international students will be able to learn the host universitiy\u0027s language quickly and will not experience language difficulties. Also with the host university, we can organize events for these penpals; for example, coffee meetings, TedTalks and other fun activities!

Pretty smart.  Certain platforms like eventbrite and meetup.io give out api\u2019s ( ask and get mechanism )  to get events from their platform. So aragog is as friendly as its claimed to be :)\n\nAragog also has the ability to listen to twitter hastags in realtime (Twitter api) ,which opens up a whole new way of communicating with aragog as an opportunity provider \/ event hoster.Event organizers in their posts can just have the custom hastags that aragog listens like #aragog-hackathon , #aragog-internship and get their events indexed as well in the platform Easy as that.For eg. Redbull could tweet information about redbull basement university with a custom hashtag #aragog-hackathon and it is now accessible to millions of students in one single tweet.No more advertising in multiple different platforms to reach students...\n\nAragog solves another important problem faced by students is to participate in team contests like hackathons or any other workshop or conference to attend with like minded people .By matching them with same or other campus students with the required skill set,this enables a whole new socializing experience and motivates students more on hackathons and team sport.Aragog was presented to one of the biggest platforms through their support mail,and we\u0027ve received positive feedback from them.\n\nFuture scope \u0026 How redbull could help aragog :\n\nImagine if aragog was allowed to scrape events like google can ,what if aragog is whitelisted like google by every event hosting platform.\n\nThis eliminates the need to listen on newsletters and makes the platform even more better.For eg. web automation is allowed in Linkedin with proper permission according to their robots.txt file.What if aragog gets through?. It would be able to listen on same hashtags it listens though twitter api for internships and these get indexed as well helping students and society on a bigger scale.A single platform that rules it all is what we propose and being computer science majors,We\u0027ve built a lot of web crawlers for our personal projects and are ready to build something crazy for the welfare of students like

due to an unscheduled venue change) in which you\u0027re not enrolled. Now, upon your entrance, you\u0027ve disturbed the momentum of the class which was proceeding; you feel embarrassed, even though it was completely unintentional as you were not informed about which course\/event was going on inside the class.\n\nThe solution which we have thought of to this problem is to install such a device outside every Lecture Theatre which displays the name of event\/course is happening inside the Lecture Theatre along with the speaker\u0027s name.\n\nThe implementation of this solution would require small LCD displays outside (at the doors) of every Lecture Theatre. On these displays, the name of course\/event happening inside Lecture Theatre would be displayed. The changes in venues would be made through a central computer which would update the data displayed on the screen via WiFi modules. We as an Electrical Engineer believe that we can implement this solution with the help of Red Bull.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/319","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LyIvT-gbBSg\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"LyIvT-gbBSg","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"pk","name":"Pakistan","nameNative":"Pakistan"},"users":[{"id":1715,"name":"Taha Jameel","country":"Pakistan"},{"id":1716,"name":"Abram Matthew","country":"Pakistan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":598,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/19 14:53:56"},{"id":1651,"title":"Captu","description":"Captu is an app that connects you to all the food spots across campus.

Students cannot tend to an event in any way because they do not know the social structures and initiatives around them. They can improve their social aspects by being involved in communities and improving their manual skills by being involved in projects. Because we are thinking in this context, we decided to produce an applicaiton to show students what communities and projects they have in their environment. Through the application, students will be able to easily access and learn about the community. They will also have the opportunity to learn and participate in community projects. The application will be able to make all kinds of community and project announcements. When we apply this system to all universities, sociality will increase significantly and many aspects of students\u0027 capacity to do business, manual skills, presentation, bilateral dialogue will develop. Although the first priority of the application is to inform students about the university communities and their projects, it is very important for the students to bring social and technical effects to the forefront.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/669","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Lf5WlyQeJPI\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Lf5WlyQeJPI","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"tr","name":"Turkey","nameNative":"T\u00fcrkiye"},"users":[{"id":2165,"name":"Muhammed Selman SOMUNCU","country":"Turkey"},{"id":2166,"name":"Mehmet Enes Fidan","country":"Turkey"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":504,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 11:53:20"},{"id":1280,"title":"Class Navigator","description":"This is a navigation app for a college campus.

Everybody is just deep into social media while being afraid of talking to others face to face and they don\u2019t feel belonging anywhere. The answer for this problem is Fit Me In: an online tool for helping people creating offline communities with those who share the same interests. The app is based on a personality test that generates better results in finding mates and also gives different social aims to the users, so Fit Me In becomes not only a social application, but also a way of personal development. An app that helps the users socialize and get to know other people through suggesting events where you can meet students who like the same things.

It also sends message of their location to concerned authorities such as Police, family members, etc so that they can act upon immediately.

Entre eles, a grande dificuldade de manter a mat\u00e9ria em dia, encontrar tempo para estudar, saber qual m\u00e9todo mais eficiente para estudar, controlar as faltas e o conte\u00fado dado em aulas, me pareceram ser os pontos de dificuldade em comum na vida dos estudantes. A minha  ideia \u00e9 criar um aplicativo para celular capaz de sanar todas as dificuldades citadas anteriormente. Um app com o design intuitivo, de modo que seja acess\u00edvel a todos os tipos de universit\u00e1rio sem distin\u00e7\u00e3o de classe e realidade social. O app Estude tem como objetivo simplificar a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o nos estudos e trazer mais equil\u00edbrio para a vida do aluno usu\u00e1rio. Por meio dos question\u00e1rios introdut\u00f3rios o app ser\u00e1 capaz de identificar o tipo de intelig\u00eancia do aluno, e poder\u00e1 a partir da\u00ed orient\u00e1-lo com os melhores m\u00e9todos de estudo para sua intelig\u00eancia; isso proporcionar\u00e1 maior qualidade nas sess\u00f5es de estudo e maior \u00edndice de aprendizado.

A Red Bull Basement University proposal 2019\n\nUniversity students will be invited from across a whole campus to\n\nplan, design, plant and cultivate Cannabis Sativa sustainable farming in regional NSW, Australia.\n\n\nCommunity capacity building will be undertaken.\n\nStakeholders will come together in a community development \/ action research style consultation via a Living Lab.\n\nThe aim is to assist farmers in diversification planting Cannabis Sativa Industrial Hemp.\u00a0\n\nWholesale Hemp (sourced.from the whole plant) for CBD oil for health is a growth area and quickly emerging market in Australia. Suppliers are in short supply.\n\nParticipants include\nuni students such as architectural, agricultural, science, business and marketing students.\n\nIt could also involve TAFE building students or apprentices, event planners and more.\n\nStudents will have an opportunity in this pilot project to provide a solution for farmers experiencing long term drought who are looking for alternative production for income. Cannabis Sativa is proposed as an option. \n\nPartners the students\u00a0 will work with will be farmers and business investors, local chamber of commerce and innovation groups as well as experinced growers.\n\nUniversities have existing innovation and start up support programs that sit outside the curriculum.\nAny university in NSW could lead this.\nTwo New South Wales (NSW) examples are University of Newcastle and UTS (Ultimo Sydney) already have innovation entrepreneur support.\n\n\nA regional area such as Goulburn in NSW have Goulburn Regional Innovation Network (GRIN) and Goulburn Connect. The Goulburn Chamber of Commerce is involved in these two regional business groups in the community.\n\n\nAs outlined structures exist for this innovative project to be expedient. The need for farmers is dire and students have an amazing opportunity to work on a national sustainable solution.\u00a0\n\n\nWater will still be needed. However recycled water for use in hydroponics is one option and local irrigation is another. Students can work with stakeholders to find solutions.\n\nIt is envisaged that one or two farms would pilot the project leading the market for others.\n\n\nAustralia already supports marijuana (Cannabis Indica) crops via expensive licences in the thousands of dollars.\u00a0 However Cannabis Sativa growers\u00a0 in Australia only nees to pay\u00a0$400\u00a0for a license.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is already a source for Cannabis Sativa seeds being offered to land owners by an Australian CBD Oil producer so importing seeds is not required. These are organic  pesticide free  \n\nThe unique aspects of the proect involve (but are not limoted to) collaboration across regional and urban development via innovation, sustainable methods and diversity.\n\nCannabis Sativa is already being successfully grown in Australia and there are proven methods that can be further developed to bring about affordable and achievable crop production which occurs within100 days from plant to harvest.\n\nThere will be challenges in developing the project which makes it exciting to university students with an entrepreneurial or project management interest. Or for those simply wanting some hands on and pracpractical experience in a new sustainable farming business venture.\n\nWhat Dr Cass integrative doctor says about CBD.\n\n\u0022Hemp oil extract is becoming increasingly popular as people discover it\u2019s many scientifically proven benefits, including improved exercise performance and recovery, balancing the immune system, and relieving pain, inflammation, stress, worry, PMS, blood sugar imbalances, digestive issues, low immunity, even bone loss\u2026 It has become a go-to remedy in my integrative\/holistic psychiatric practice especially in one of my areas of specialty \u2013helping individuals recover from the use of substances of abuse as well as wean off psychiatric medications, easing and shortening the transition by supplying much-needed neurotransmitters, such as Dopamine for focus, GABA for calming, and Serotonin for mood maintenance\u0022.\u00a0\n\nCBD oil triggers feel good responses and regulates the bodies immune and neuro systems.\n\nCoordinators of the social enterpirse development project are Serena Scarlett and Fiona Dechaineux.\nFiona has a background in social development, holds a Bachelor Media Communication from Charles Sturt University, ILO Gender and Development certification, and academic certificates in entrepreneurial\/innovation ecosystem (incl mind mapping), business structuring, ideation and innovation for value and growth from NSW\u2019s university conglomerate, the Sydney School of Entrepreneurship\n\nSerena Scarlett has a B.App. Sci. in Health Education majoring in Community Development.\n\nWith 25 years community experience  further qualifications and experience in Business mentoring and group training Serena is highly suited to coordinate this dynamic project. Serena can develop this program soley if only one person rather than a team of two can win the competition.\n\nHowever Fiona complements the project with her wide ranging expertise working with international communities as well as local businesses.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1257","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A41gzYRJ-4Y\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"A41gzYRJ-4Y","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"au","name":"Australia","nameNative":"Australia"},"users":[{"id":39652,"name":"Serena Scarlett","country":"Australia"},{"id":39653,"name":"Fiona Dechaineux","country":"Australia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":4,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/27 22:03:41"},{"id":1476,"title":"Reserversity","description":"Reserversity is a joint word made by reservation and university.

We started working on this idea about 4 months ago. This problem stemmed from 3 main issues. The first problem- missed learning opportunities; Classroom learning only provides a portion of education, we want to get to \u0022deeper\u0022 learning. The second problem is limited professional experience in college. Classroom learning provides limited opportunities for developing interpersonal and professional competencies expected of the next leaders in the world. The last problem is getting a job after college: Getting to know your employer prior to applying for a job is crucial because 85% of jobs are filled via networking (LinkedIn). \n\n\nOverview:\nOur platform is stimulating events in and around universities through gamification, creating a competitive atmosphere in which students build knowledge, skills, and abilities (networking, courage, creativity) that are crucial in the professional world. \n\n\nHow it works:\nStudents can easily find events on our platform, earn points from attending these events, and redeem them for prizes including academic credit, scholarships, or experiences in your city (like skydiving). \n\nIf a student would like to attend an event that isn\u2019t listed by the university (for example, an off-campus Red Bull event) they can simply request to earn points for the event, which incentivizes them to attend it. \n\n\nAccountability:\nEvents are geofenced which keeps students accountable for actually attending events. When a student is in the proximity of the event location, they begin to earn points. When they leave the \u201cfenced proximity\u201d they are no longer earning points. \n\n\nBenefits:\nOur platform is helping students build skills that are necessary to land the jobs they desire. This also benefits a university because it gives them analytics on event performance and improves student outcomes which gives universities more recognition. \n\n\nUsability:\nAdvantage technology is used by students, administrators and event organizers. Here\u2019s how: \n\nStudents\n-See RSVP\u0027d events \n-Track points accumulated in key competencies \n-Enhance the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities that provide a professional competitive advantage. \n\nAdministrators\n-Analyze students progress towards point accumulation\n\u2028-Guide students towards programs that lead to professional success \n-Assess student learning outcomes and the impact of mission programming. \n\nEvent Organizers\n-Schedule events\u2028\n-Track event analytics\n\u2028-Check students in digitally\u2028\n-Ensure quality event experiences with the help of integrated feedback to make data-driven decisions on future programming. \n\n\nTraction:\nAdvantage Tech has entered a multi-year license agreement with Loyola Marymount University, making Advantage a new component to degree curriculum beginning Fall 2020. We\u2019ve also landed a feature in BizEd\u2019s November edition magazine giving us exposure to over 600 universities!\n\n\nOur Team:\nAdvantage Technology was created by 3 college seniors who\u2019ve created multiple softwares in the past; ranging from peer-to-peer parking solutions to education technology. Our diverse team includes Adam Rodriguez (Finance Major), Tyler Valentine (Political Science), and Joseph Screen (Entrepreneurship). We\u2019re passionate about improving student outcomes because we\u2019ve seen first hand how difficult it is to succeed in the professional world given our experience through building software companies.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1271","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zt9Wq1LTSUU\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Zt9Wq1LTSUU","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"us","name":"United States","nameNative":"United States"},"users":[{"id":1270,"name":"Adam Rodriguez","country":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":54,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 08:13:39"},{"id":469,"title":"Tanks for sorting garbage","description":"My idea is to put garbage cans on campuses and dormitories.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/469","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NoulLYUf_BI\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"NoulLYUf_BI","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1905,"name":"\u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d  \u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0443\u043a ","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 17:46:05"},{"id":1042,"title":"Mr","description":"Mobile application that will track movement of the street vendors so that their customers can be aware of their current location in real time to be able to purchase their goods","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1042","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R5HqsHcbOWg\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"R5HqsHcbOWg","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":32298,"name":"Tiyani Hlungwani","country":"South Africa"},{"id":32299,"name":"Fumani Hlungwani","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/25 12:45:02"},{"id":1483,"title":"SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND RECOGNITION USING A WEB BASED PLATFORM","description":"For graduates who lack skill to become job ready and for people who have skills, but not getting enough opportunities. we have created a network of companies willing to hire\/intern skilled students with the required skillset. using a web application, starting from the first year of college, the students are provided resources to enhance their skill, and the same is displayed in the application once the student earns the skill. companies can use the app to hire\/intern the students with the required skill. the idea is to bridge the gap between the conventional hiring process by promoting skill based hiring techniques.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1483","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IIa5mo-qWCE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"IIa5mo-qWCE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":89013,"name":"Bijoy Sijo","country":"India"},{"id":89014,"name":"Akhil Raphael Joseph","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":119,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 17:13:59"},{"id":1613,"title":"Talks Channel","description":"Aiming to spread the knowledge produced in universities we decided to create a channel audience-oriented towards academics, filming short talks with Unicuritbas\u2019s Professors.

Once the person has entered the shower and to made sure that only the top of the panel is open and 50 ml of liquid soap has been placed, activates the tap to the maximum level and rotate around it slowly under high pressure foamy water (25 bar) for a total of 30 seconds then wash the armpit and hair\/beard in the in 15 seconds. The person can scrub the desired parts while washing. In the same way, person can be washed easily with pressurized soap water using the bottom of the panel (without fiber). \nImportance and Business Potential of Fast Shower Panel:\n     \n       This panel is a panel that I designed individually and I found that there was no such panel on my research on the official and worldwide patents of the Turkish Patent Institute.\n       Especially if a company that has a certain place in the world which this fast shower panel enters into its own field, target can be reached directly.\n         If production started as a small company it should be targeted opening to the world starting from Turkey.\n        In addition, the possibility of fast ablution, which is another feature of the panel, reveals the potential of the panel to sell to countries that have adopted Islam.\n        It is quite possible to sell 1 billion units of this panel in the world population of 8 billion. For Turkey it is seen that the average population of 70 million, 12 million of which has the potential to receive 4, though the average number of people in the household, though, and only 3 million sales potential for Turkey.\n\nResolved issues:         \n \nThe fast shower panel I have designed provides very clear solutions in terms of waste of time and water in the shower:\n         Time-wasting: Provides an effective shower in just 10 minutes.\n          Water wastage: Normally 2.5 buckets of water is consumed in a shower taken with this panel, while 1 bucket of water can be showered with this panel.\n          This fast shower panel is also designed to be used in any shower.\n\n\nPurposes:\n\n\n1.\tThe aim is to provide a shower panel which allows fast showering without using fibers in a linear spacing with foamy (soapy) water under high and low pressure.\n2.\tTo save water (up to 50%) and time (up to 50%).\n3.\tIt is to realize a shower panel that can be attached to each shower.\n4.\tIt is an economical (cheap) but convenient shower panel (smart use of water).\n5.\tIt is to perform a shower panel that allows you to get faster height ablution.\n6.\tIt is an invention which does not require fiber to be used when used with foam water.\n\nOther benefits include:\n\n1.\tTo be used for preventing cellulite formation.\n2.\tCan be used to prevent sagging of the abdomen and arm.\n3.\tCan be used to benefit from the benefits of aromatic oils useful to the body.\n4.\tCan be used with the aim of massaging with fast water particles to various parts of the body.\n\nTarget Group:            \n        \n           1) Water wastage is one of the most important problems that are being solved in all aspects today and this situation affects everyone. There are two problems directly affecting individuals. The first is a livable world. In our world, where the rate of clean water is gradually decreasing, everyone using this panel will make a significant contribution to the water use cycle. Secondly, there will be a reduction of up to 50% in the amount of money spent on water in the monthly shower, especially for places with water problems economically. This topic is discussed under \u2018Cleantech\u2019.\n          2) A waste of time, today everyone wants to be faster and more practical or to get busy with less work because they are already tired enough. In this case, the shower time is reduced to only 10 minutes (in total, washing the whole body in 2.5 minutes with liquid soap + hair \/ beard shampooing in 7.5 minutes washing), this panel removes one more burden on individuals in daily life.\n  \n           These two issues that I have explained separately will be of particular interest to the masses who are busy with their daily lives and care about a livable world. For example, it is a panel that can be found attractive in daily life, especially for someone who has a busy course period or someone preparing a project. In addition, everyone wants to do things in a practical way without exception.\n\nTechnological Innovation:\n            \n        The fast shower panel I have designed is a clear innovation in terms of functionality that concerns the field of innovation. And this innovation has considerable money potential and is not difficult to produce. The real purpose of this business idea is to make money by producing a useful and new product.\n         Since the design of the panel part of this system is the most important part, 2 front and 1 main (main) applications have been made to the Turkish Patent Institute and their file numbers are:\n\nHIZLI DU\u015e APARATI: 2018\/21025  Application date:2018\/12\/28\nHIZLI DU\u015e S\u0130STEM\u0130: 2019\/10784  Application date:2019\/07\/19\nHIZLI DU\u015e PANEL\u0130: 2019\/11616  (MAIN APPLICATION)  Application date:2019\/07\/31\n\nApplication has been made to obtain patents in foreign countries via ePCT, the file numbers are:\n\nFAST SHOWER APPARATUS: PCT\/TR2019\/050553   Application date:2019\/07\/09\nFAST SHOWER SYSTEM: PCT\/TR2019\/050598       Application date:2019\/07\/19\nFAST SHOWER PANEL: PCT\/TR2019\/11616        Application date:2019\/07\/31\n\nCommercialization Plan:\n \n             Especially if a company which has certain places in the world and especially this fast shower panel enters into its own field sells this panel, target can be reached directly.\n            Since the introduction of innovation-related products is very important, it is appropriate to start the promotion with the title \u2018Fast and Water-Saving Shower Panel\u2019 over the internet. In this way, very clear steps will be taken.\n              It is convenient to start production without the use of automation system first and it is quite simple but time consuming. As long as sufficient profit is achieved, the automation system can be switched. It is quite clear that there is potential for commercialization.\n \nRevenue model:\n       \n      Total revenue will be generated through sales. (Not through subscription, etc.).\n      It is the easiest way for this panel to be sold worldwide by a company with a wide network and related to this sector. In this way, a percentage of the total profit is allocated.\n      When growth is targeted through a small company, production and promotion is started and continued with a limited team of people.\n        These two ways take steps in the form of produce, promote and sell.\n\nURL:\n       Video of the fast shower panel display and the way it works:\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/zAhiWTDdUKg\n\nUse guide:\n     \nEverybody, especially those who take a shower every day, can use it if they are tired, sick or want to take a simple, comfortable, practical and effective shower.\nAfter washing your head with your hair;\n1) After first selecting one of the upper or lower arm, open the valve connected to the reservoir and slowly fill 40-50 ml(quarter cup) of liquid soap (Total 20 sec).\n2) After filling the liquid soap, turn the tap to a maximum or near maximum level, making sure that only the nozzle on the respective arm is open.\n 3) Pressurized foamed water provides effective 35 seconds washing for 40-50 ml of liquid soap. You can achieve a similar result with fiber by washing the upper and lower parts of your body as described below.\nUpside:\n-Turn around and perform a 10-second turn.                                                                                                                                                - Then turn your armpits which aren\u2019t washed by turning them forward or backward separately for 4\u2019secs (8 seconds total).\n- Turn your inner arm forward or backward for 4 seconds (8 seconds total).\nUnder Part:\n- Make a 10-second turn by turning around.\t\n- Perform your 4 seconds wash by advancing your back part back or forth.\n- Advance the inner part of your legs forward and backward separately for 2 seconds (4 seconds total).\n- Carry out a 4 second wash by advancing your front part back or forth.\t\t\n- Move the bottom of your feet forward and backward for 4 seconds each (8 seconds total) and wash your toes by using your hands (5 seconds total).\n4) Finally turn around for 8 minutes to rinse.\nTotal washing time:\n(Head wash) 8min + (Remaining body wash) 2min = (Whole body) 10min\nIn this way, an average of 20 liters of water is also consumed during washing, which is equivalent to approximately 1 large water.\nNote: You can also rub your body with your hands and the use of fibers in intermittent time periods is recommended.\nNote: The Fast Shower Column only cleans flat(open) surfaces of the body completely.\nNote: When you want to drain liquid soap directly, with the tap closed, fully open the soap dispensing valve and then open the tap.\n\nCompetitor:\n\nSince the design of the fast shower panel belongs entirely to me with the above patent application numbers, there are no direct competitors.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/247","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/p1-7Xj5BgJM\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"p1-7Xj5BgJM","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"tr","name":"Turkey","nameNative":"T\u00fcrkiye"},"users":[{"id":1604,"name":"Berkay Eken","country":"Turkey"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/18 07:16:20"},{"id":1500,"title":"College Maps","description":"To build an platform from where the students can locate their respective classrooms, college canteens etc.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1500","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-xl6VcaM4qs\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"-xl6VcaM4qs","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":90209,"name":"Vrishank Suri","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 17:30:31"},{"id":754,"title":"ExamBuddy","description":"The idea is about an application which consists of all the past exam papers so the students can study from it.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/754","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xtyk5oIrTpo\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Xtyk5oIrTpo","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ru","name":"Russian Federation","nameNative":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f"},"users":[{"id":2270,"name":"Alizey Sultan","country":"Russian Federation"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 17:48:20"},{"id":1675,"title":"Uni Cal","description":"Personalised societies events calendar","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1675","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eXKwIXGd7mY\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"eXKwIXGd7mY","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"au","name":"Australia","nameNative":"Australia"},"users":[{"id":110264,"name":"Vivian Ho","country":"Australia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 22:39:43"},{"id":1673,"title":"Improving The Student Experience","description":"Mobile\/Web App that makes asking questions easy and allows for student teacher course collaboration.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1673","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZMBCq6gPTOE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"ZMBCq6gPTOE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"us","name":"United States","nameNative":"United States"},"users":[{"id":1268,"name":"Jeremy Randall","country":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":11,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 22:37:12"},{"id":461,"title":"Bikes for campus","description":"I propose to creating an application in which a student can register using his student card, scan number of bike and quickly get from hostel to university .

This can be across many games and genres (and will grow our database over time), history, for example, learned throughout various games. Level 1 video game-based learnings (History). This is something users would be able to do after playing a game, \u201cI wonder what real learnings was in that game?\u201d for example, Assassins Creed. Some of that history about the American civil war was accurate (this also tells the users what wasn\u2019t true or likely to be true due to it not being on the test).\n\u2022\tThese tests can be sat unlimited times (unlike traditional exams)\n\u2022\tSome games will have more academic learnings, other games less so. It might not be enough in one game to get to level1 also the learnings will be at different levels.\n\u2022\tSo, playing several games and them being verified as having the game patch will lead to the first level of the history award being unlocked (in this case).\n\nThe technology involved:\n\u2022\tAt the beginning would be a website and the user would use their computer\/tablet\/phone camera to record themselves doing the test LIVE to prove it was them that sat the test (as security) also our patch would eventually be needed to prove that the player actually played the game.\n\u2022\tThen later use Blockchain to store unchangeable records of the gamer-student\u2019s academic gaming achievements.\n\u2022\tLater, an Education patch would plug straight into the game (optional plug-in) and the tests would be done to progress to the next level for example, including having an icon display (in gameplay).\n\u2022\tThat a learning was happening (this is real knowledge) with the Education patch symbol activated.\nNEED TO CREATE THIS LOGO\n\nSo why is this the perfect time?\n\u2022\tRight now, unfortunately, there is a lot of stigma about games being just a waste of time and only being violent.\n\u2022\tBoth the gaming industry would jump on this opportunity to having gaming seen in a more positive light.\n\u2022\tAnd the education systems around the world in Ed-Tech. Who are always looking at new ways to engage students in this new high-tech world, where it has been proven by many educational specialspecialists Ray O\u2019Brien) game-based learning might be the best way to learn, ever?\n\u2022\tThey are later pitching this to the gaming companies to \u201cadd value\u201d to their games (without being competition but also not burdening them) by having this new startup manage this #EducationPatch on their behalf. With the main hope would be gaming companies would work together with us to add educational elements to games as an optional extra (our Ed. patch) to enhance our informative piece even more.\n\n\u201cImagine playing a video game, like Cyberpunk 2077 and you have to code a d, or to get entrance into an enemy HQ. We have just activated #theEducationalPatch; you might have to learn some real coding to unlock that door, it takes a bit longer to get that door open, but you gain some actual coding knowledge how exciting would that be? And then you can put those learnings towards accumulated learnings in other games and other levels towards your EducationPatch coding award. We envision @Digital Vision a world where the classroom and the videogame have merged, creating what we like to call the gamer-student.\u201d\n\nMichael Spicer CEO\u0026Founder of Digital Vision AKA MyCool-Enterprises","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/256","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/823516595_640x360.jpg?r=pad","youtube_video_id":null,"vimeo_video_id":"367231069","country":{"code":"nz","name":"New Zealand","nameNative":"New Zealand"},"users":[{"id":1621,"name":"Michael Spicer","country":"New Zealand"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":4,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/18 11:58:53"},{"id":514,"title":"Red Bull Basement University | \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432","description":"\u0417\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0439 .\n\u0418\u043b\u0438 \u0441 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430. \n\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0448 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 .\n\u042f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f 10\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438.\n\u0418 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433  \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0435.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/514","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gw386jUCbu4\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Gw386jUCbu4","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1961,"name":"\u0420\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0424\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 19:25:16"},{"id":1425,"title":"ParkEase","description":"To ensure hassle free parking,  ParkEase books nearest free parking slots in a structured parking lot, both indoor and outdoor, for vehicles by scanning a QR Code, navigating the driver to the destination and would generate an E-bill, thus, automating the entire process.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1425","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YRSabniisRY\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"YRSabniisRY","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":81752,"name":"Avani Jindal","country":"India"},{"id":81753,"name":"Shriya Sehgal","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":50,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 14:54:07"},{"id":201,"title":"The app inform lecture cancellation automatically \u0022kyuukou-kun\u0022","description":"When you were university student, you thought your teacher is late, but it was lecture cancellation.\nHave you experienced like this?\nThis app can solve this problem!","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/201","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bVOnZQXdqaA\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"bVOnZQXdqaA","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"jp","name":"Japan","nameNative":"\u65e5\u672c"},"users":[{"id":1331,"name":"Hikaru Kubo","country":"Japan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":23,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/16 13:18:00"},{"id":1571,"title":"Espacio Vegano","description":"There are many alternatives to buy food inside the university, but, at the same time, there are no vegan options that are really nutritious.

Humans with better emotional status and stability are more productive and can perform better and thus the throughput of the organisation\/institution increases. Due to unforeseen circumstances if the psychological stability of a person is damaged then the performance of the person and the organisation as a whole is reduced. The Emotion Declination is generally gradual process for stable individual and if rectified and consulted in the earlier stages, clinical depression and other psychological disorders can be avoided.\n\nEmotional Analysis cannot be quantified currently and the therapy provided is symptomatic since secretion of neurotransmitter cannot be measured by using any kind of medical instrument.\nThus, the idea is to develop a headgear to analyse the emotion status of an individual and classify and quantify it. An EEG tracks and records brain wave patterns. Small metal discs with thin wires (electrodes) are placed on the scalp, and then send signals to a computer to record the results. Normal electrical activity in the brain makes a recognizable pattern. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test used to find problems related to electrical activity of the brain. A Headgear with EEG Sensor will be used to take data from the brain in the form cranial waves viz. Alpha, Beta, Gamma Waves under standardized emotional test where the candidate will be subjected to videos and situation to get the emotional cranial waves to assess their emotional status against a standardized emotional dataset.\nThe standardized emotional dataset will be created by sampling x no. of individuals subjected to variety of circumstancial tests to improve the accuracy and avoid any kind of biases. Then it will be quantified into a physical measurement. The new candidate\u2019s emotional status would be compared to the physical units to declare an emotional status whether they are happy, sad, angry, depressed and so on.\n\nThe data acquired needs to filtered and process so that only cranial data is present which will be done by signal processing and computational methods. Then the processed data will be used to create statistical models and emotional behaviours which then will be mapped to these models to quantify them based on the tests and physical observations. The dataset will be broadened and updated regularly to increase accuracy and prevent any biases. The models generated will be used to derive meaningful results and give information about the specifics of the person\u2019s emotions viz. happy,sad, angry, excited and give a conclusion about a person\u2019s emotional health and give a detailed description of their emotional status along with the statistical measures. Then this data would be used for Unsupervised Learning to recognise patterns which haven\u2019t been seen before. Artificial Intelligence will empower this dataset and increase the efficiency manifold. AI will be used to automate and make the system smart.\n \nClinical Depression and other mental disorders are neglected by society and are left untreated. Even the current medical science has not been able to quantify it. This causes extreme inadequacies in the society and perturbs the harmony. Candidates need to have a threshold emotional status unit to enter jobs and educational institutions but currently there is no specific measure to do this and is generally gauged in the personal interviews and due the high pressure circumstance it is not reliable. If the system is developed and field tested, this will be used to generate a perfect emotion status threshold value to analyse and upgrade recruiting process and to improve them greater than ever and at the same time analyse the status of the current employees and analyse their retention rates and throughput with emotional health.\n\nCandidates below the threshold will be given medical assistance and consultation to improve their ESU (Emotional Status Unit). It will become the physical unit which will be used to gauge any kind of organisation or institution.\n\nCEBIQ under Celluron (This will be the name of the Company in the future) will the central stronghold of this establishment and will responsible for standardizing and providing consultation service to companies to improve their ESU. It will be future of analysing human behaviour and get closer to demystifying it.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1625","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/VNHpho50CRc\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"VNHpho50CRc","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":102033,"name":"Soumyadeb Bhattacharjee","country":"India"},{"id":106299,"name":"Gopala Dhar","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 21:30:37"},{"id":1034,"title":"Visionaire","description":"A shopping app that enables blind people to shop.

realized, that it can be quit a challenge to have to try getting used to University-life completely by yourself. It can also be very challenging to find the right fellow students to create a good-working studygroup, for example. \n\nThat is the reason why we came up with the idea to create the Unison Groupfinder. Nowadays exists a variety of different Social Media platforms but not a single one for meeting new people with similar interests and especially finding new groups of people. We believe that finding people with similar interest should be easier today and an App could be the solution for this issue.\n\nWith \u0027Unison_Groupfinder\u0027 you will be able to search for groups with certain interests, based on certain criterias you can choose. By creating an interest like e.g. \u0022Learngroup 1 semester economics tomorrow\u0022, all other students from your university or city are able to see and enter your request. If enough people joined the request, an in App groupchat will be found and specific details can be discussed. Through that way you would be able to find fellow students to settle down together easily even before university starts, but also in the middle of your study time if you wish to meet new people. The App will also help you in other situations, for example to find good trustworthy people that live close to you in order to go home together at night, because together you are always safer than when you are alone. \n\nIf you too want to spend your time at university with the very best friends possible, give us your vote so that we can make this idea reality soon.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1224","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q2dQit4x-74\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"q2dQit4x-74","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"de","name":"Germany","nameNative":"Deutschland"},"users":[{"id":55893,"name":"Joshua Spingler","country":"Germany"},{"id":55894,"name":"Marcel Schlegel","country":"Germany"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":64,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/27 17:02:53"},{"id":1194,"title":"classmate","description":"Classmate is a smart recording device that records the class lecture and those lectures can be accessed by classmate app. This app also has few other features like, It shows when and where your class starts and at what time the professor arrives in the classroom and it also able to give the live location of the professor you need to see.

Phase 2: Is the habit modification phase in which the user will slowly increase the duration between breaks each week of the program, consequently reducing the number of smoke breaks taken each week until no more smoke breaks are taken throughout the day. Disband simply trains the smoker to develop the habit of only smoking when a vibration is felt, the user will eventually only desire a smoke break when that vibration is present. Therefore, the user will not smoke when the wearable device doesn\u2019t vibrate anymore and is eventually not even worn anymore.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1009","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pHmZQnXrQ0A\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"pHmZQnXrQ0A","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"us","name":"United States","nameNative":"United States"},"users":[{"id":28394,"name":"Cole Lawson","country":"United States"},{"id":28395,"name":"Robert Moore","country":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":158,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/25 02:22:05"},{"id":690,"title":"Smart system","description":"System, which will split students into groups, and distribute groups to auditoriums in order to minimize the waiting time between the lectures and the distance between auditiries","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/690","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4YvUalgqaDc\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"4YvUalgqaDc","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2188,"name":"Georgiy Solomanchuk","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 13:18:17"},{"id":1349,"title":"Make you passionate!!","description":"Do you like magazines?

Zewail City of Science and Technology, Egypt. Delivered by top-notch Arabic-speaking Egyptian professors and researchers, Zewail City\u0027s courses are expected to provide an accessible thorough training in different scientific fields to Egyptian and Arabian students, researchers, educators and self-learners. Our Online platform will be a window opened for everyone starting by our university students at Zewail City, moving to anyone in the world. The project\u2019s social impact in Zewail City is obvious, and expanding where our students now have the chance to attend their lectures during their college day, and then have access to watch it on our YouTube Channel, with very high quality, during the same week. Also, the lecture\u2019s Lecture notes are hand-taken by members of our team who are enrolled in the same course, then they are written using LaTeX format in a very organized way, and published with their corresponding lecture on the channel. Same process applies for the courses assignments, quizzes, and exams. Moreover, ZC OCW aims to enhance the student\u2019s college life using an additional service, by collecting their arising questions and concerns related to university, sending them to their preferred professors, and recording the professors answers in interviews that is made available to them on the same online platform. Parallel to this, ZC OCW targets students around the world, not only those who are enrolled in ZC, as we believe that this content shouldn\u0027t be exclusive to the very small number of students at our university, but everyone deserves to experience the quality of top-notch education. And by doing this, we are presenting high quality education, in Arabic language, where such knowledge would help all these willing learners to gain the knowledge it takes to tackle the challenges faced by the world every day.\n\nInfo. About Zewail City: Established in 1999, and inaugurated in 2011 by the Egyptian Nobel Laureate, Professor Ahmed Zewail, Zewail City of Science and Technology aims to establish a scientific renaissance in Egypt. Since its establishment, it is led by world-class Egyptian researchers and professors, and has succeeded to attract a handful of Egypt\u0027s most brilliant students.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/653","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Kr1P4Awv2lE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Kr1P4Awv2lE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"eg","name":"Egypt","nameNative":"\u0645\u0635\u0631\u200e"},"users":[{"id":2144,"name":"Toqa Allah Waleed","country":"Egypt"},{"id":2145,"name":"Touka Mohamed","country":"Egypt"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2288,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 09:56:15"},{"id":621,"title":"The Mapambo Platform","description":"Mapambo is a online website\/mobile application platform, that aims to transform how College and University students access and receive Beauty and Grooming services","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/621","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fjty_ugLwcw\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"fjty_ugLwcw","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ke","name":"Kenya","nameNative":"Kenya"},"users":[{"id":2102,"name":"Brian Muchunku","country":"Kenya"},{"id":2103,"name":"Ann Gichuki","country":"Kenya"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":92,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 07:37:26"},{"id":1557,"title":"Pick me","description":"Um aplicativo de intera\u00e7\u00e3o de alunos de determinada faculdade onde compartilham caronas.

To solve this problem, we came up with a solution to developing and installing new software on school computers to monitor such devices. This software will be programmed in a manner that if a user tries to logout from a computer, there will be a pop-up window notifying the user that he\/she cannot log out without removing his\/her external device.

But, where does this leave our universities? Where does this leave students who everyday struggle to learn, get to campus, find their voice, create new bonds, earn money or just feel safe?\n\nSexual assaults on campus and safety are examples of systemic issues that universities globally struggle to combat. Anxiety and stress are also issues that relate to the demands of university life: peer pressure, marginalisation, bad diet (in some cases malnutrition) and economic constraints. This also applies to academics and staff who often have little time to provide quality help to students due to highly competitive environments and little resources.\n\nSo, how do we find a way to rectify these issues and create environments that encourage wellbeing, promote connectedness and safety on campus? We change campus culture to one of wellbeing, and:  \n-        create spaces for people to heal and grow;\n-        create spaces that improve systemic, social and economic issues; and,\n-        break down barriers, build community cohesiveness by connecting students and teachers and encourage them to bring their families and friends onto campus.\n \nThe World Bank, country donors (DFID, DFAT, USAID etc), European Investment Bank and Asian Development Bank profess to have innovative social development solutions, plans and policies to improve SDG outcomes in urban spaces, but they aren\u2019t always impactful.  I believe that by combing their practices with over 30 popular urban design processes and Stamford d. School\u2019s Design Thinking elements (empathy, observe, engage and immerse) that we can deeply improve and make an impact to sustainable urban planning for universities globally.\n\nThis strategy will resolve several systemic issues and develop a cohesive blueprint for wellbeing and economic growth on campus.\n\nABOUT ME: Fiona has a background in aid and social development through her work at the AusAID and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. For over 10 years she has been helping businesses and governments to improve social and economic outcomes globally through human-centered design (HDC), Consumer Insights, shared value, mind mapping, innovation, and marketing techniques that reduce costs and truly disrupt. \n\n\nFiona has a background in social development, holds a Bachelor Media Communication from Charles Sturt University, ILO Gender and Development certification, and academic certificates in entrepreneurial\/innovation ecosystem (incl mind mapping), business structuring, ideation and innovation for value and growth from NSW\u2019s university conglomerate, the Sydney School of Entrepreneurship.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1668","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1n5wm9l6dxs\/hqdefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"1n5wm9l6dxs","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"au","name":"Australia","nameNative":"Australia"},"users":[{"id":39653,"name":"Fiona Dechaineux","country":"Australia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 22:33:41"},{"id":1347,"title":"The Feelings Field","description":"The Feelings Field is a design solution seeking to tackle the harmful culture of suppressing unpleasant feelings in a university context. \n\nThrough this project, we aim to address social isolation and encourage emotional introspection and in doing so, raise the status-quo of student well-being.\n\nIn practice, the Feelings Field is a collection of students feelings displayed on aggregate in a public setting, manifest as an artistic, animated, live-updating visualisation.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1347","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/B-21vbaq8QU\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"B-21vbaq8QU","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"au","name":"Australia","nameNative":"Australia"},"users":[{"id":1553,"name":"Justin Mitchell","country":"Australia"},{"id":71629,"name":"Alisdair Gurling","country":"Australia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":3,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 11:54:53"},{"id":1486,"title":"Talto - Talents of Tomorrow","description":"With Talto, students build the bridge from study to work life.

And that\u0027s why the Talent Elevator, Vienna\u0027s most exclusive career event in business and technology, was created. The heart of the all-day student event, which will take place next time on 8 May 2020 at the SO\/ Vienna Hotel, is a workshop where attractive companies will provide insights into their daily work and corporate philosophy. The event is rounded off by company presentations, exciting keynotes and numerous networking opportunities, such as lunch at the LOFT with a view over the rooftops of Vienna, a networking dinner or an after-event.

Students can share Novels, Extra Books, old notes etc on this application. BookStock also provides a feature of one on one chat between students, thus further helping them to socialize.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1598","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XBJ62p8uqjk\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"XBJ62p8uqjk","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":102440,"name":"Diksha Mehta","country":"India"},{"id":102441,"name":"Divya Ratra","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":45,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 20:27:49"},{"id":363,"title":"Campus life","description":"This describes the campus life","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/363","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/823951827_640x360.jpg?r=pad","youtube_video_id":null,"vimeo_video_id":"367540646","country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":1774,"name":"Muskan Garg","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 08:28:46"},{"id":991,"title":"eLeNeF","description":"Hey guys,\nWe from HEXADECIPALS have come up with an innovative solution to find products misplaced in a workspace environment.\n\nEach of your valuable products will need to be attached with a HEXA-Tag this tag allows the drone which is the carrier for the transmitters and receivers to locate your device\/anything that was misplaced.

So, we invite young backpackers from abroad to our shared house to exchange cultures. \nSeveral months in a stylish and global shared house on Okinawa island will be the greatest experience in their lives.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1198","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DLzmHwcb2h0\/hqdefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"DLzmHwcb2h0","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"jp","name":"Japan","nameNative":"\u65e5\u672c"},"users":[{"id":52362,"name":"Masaru Yamashiro","country":"Japan"},{"id":52363,"name":"Soichiro Kito","country":"Japan"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":24,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/27 11:19:40"},{"id":594,"title":"Food way","description":"1) Information about products from the nearest stores and their prices.\n2) Plan your meals.\n3) Recipes of main dishes.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/594","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/13MgSW5KQ10\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"13MgSW5KQ10","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ru","name":"Russian Federation","nameNative":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f"},"users":[{"id":2058,"name":"Vladislav Smolin","country":"Russian Federation"},{"id":2059,"name":"Gleb Gulyaykin","country":"Russian Federation"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 23:31:42"},{"id":844,"title":"Project","description":"Improve situation with parking","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/844","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8FSAk03s3os\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"8FSAk03s3os","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2409,"name":"\u0413\u043b\u0435\u0431 \u0427\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0451\u0432","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":3,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 19:51:01"},{"id":529,"title":"\u041b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0423\u041c\u0421\u0410","description":"\u041b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0423\u041c\u0421\u0410","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/529","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/363Jv6C7tlQ\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"363Jv6C7tlQ","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1976,"name":"\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0456\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e-\u041e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446\u044c","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 20:19:42"},{"id":811,"title":"Uninotify","description":"The idea is to create an app that is going to ease the life of anew students in the university that is going to help the student know more about the school activities","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/811","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/U6ZTrzbcfHE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"U6ZTrzbcfHE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ke","name":"Kenya","nameNative":"Kenya"},"users":[{"id":2346,"name":"Joyce Nyambura","country":"Kenya"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":16,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 19:04:01"},{"id":233,"title":"StudySpaces","description":"My goal is to track the amount of students in study locations around campus.

Doesn\u2019t seem so. When we add on the long queue at the canteen, waiting for our food being prepared, hours feel like seconds, So here\u2019s introducing \u201cSWISHH \u201c ; an app where you can pre book your food order, and then you can have your food ready when you reach the canteen. \nYou can save your recess just by following a few simple steps. The app will have the whole canteen menu from where you can choose what you want along with the quantity. It will provide an option of \u201cPay Now\u201d (which includes both online and cash payment options) and \n\u201cAdd to account\u201d option. \nYou can maintain a payments account on the app and pay later according to your convenience. The maximum time lease is up for the college administration to decide.  By segregating the canteen counter into paid and unpaid, the service becomes smoother. \nIf you choose to pay immediately, an order number will be generated in the format \u201cdate-serial no\u201d that is in the form \u201cddmmyyxxxx\u201d . The length of the serial no will be different for different colleges, to be decided keeping in mind the average daily footfall. You scan your QR code at the counter, pay the amount and enjoy ready food. \nUser will also be provided a digital wallet within the app where they can recharge from time to time from the canteen counter or directly from their bank account for quick payment. \nAt the canteen administration\u2019s end, the app interface will have a list of the orders received, arranged in a chronological order. When an order is prepared, the administration can select the \u201cPrepared\u201d option against each order and that will automatically notify the customer. After service, selecting the \u201cServed\u201d option will notify the customer accordingly. The administration will also have access to user database where past orders and payments due information will be available. They will set a time\/ amount limit on the due section, which when crossed, the student will receive an auto generated notification. \nThe students can also view their own previous orders and account details on the app. \nThe app can be used by students, faculty and administrative staff. It will make our lunch breaks a lot smoother and we can save time for other activities. \nThank You.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1627","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N4zAgdoNpRc\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"N4zAgdoNpRc","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":103174,"name":"ADM AHMED MULLICK","country":"India"},{"id":106372,"name":"AHONA MITRA","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 21:31:51"},{"id":657,"title":"Winter room","description":"room with snow generators, warm tea, for the adaptation of visiting guests in winter Kharkov","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/657","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OETRS91_tqk\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"OETRS91_tqk","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2150,"name":"\u0410\u043d\u044f Tkachenko","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":131,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 10:35:17"},{"id":30,"title":"Dropper","description":"Dropper is an app that identifies the number of people present and available seats in classrooms, saving users serious time and energy.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/30","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/G2A-185WViw\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"G2A-185WViw","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":28,"name":"Khayelihle Ngcobo","country":"South Africa"},{"id":29,"name":"Sandile Mbatha","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/09\/10 20:43:26"},{"id":1495,"title":"Waste Recycling APP","description":"The idea is to use the boom that exists with the delivery boys, which today is only about dispatching products to the customer so taking these advantage to be able to remove waste from homes at the same time.

Then these products reach the counterfeiters and their investment converts to loss.\nWe propose a sophisticated authentication system called the OTR-Mark, a one-of-a-kind, cloud-based authentication engine that uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and decentralized block chain database to detect and reject fake goods.\nThe process starts with a brand or company becoming a member of OTR platform upon which it can use the platform\u0027s service to generate randomized, unit-level identification codes called an \u0022OTR Code\u0022 displayed in the form of a simple QR Code on every unit produced. The Business will receive an \u0022OTR code\u0022 for manufactured items only when it provides the Batch number, Bar code details, Manufacturing date and relative details of every unit. Hence any Business can receive a unique OTR code for an item only on successfully providing the item\u0027s identification details. The Identification details provided by the businesses will be stored on a decentralized database using block chain technology to ensure that these details are not explicitly used by any individual or group to produce counterfeit goods. Block chain ensures transparent transactions among the authorized members and implement a non-destructive way of storing information.\nPrinting and using these OTR codes on products require that they are made hidden by printing Opaque Scratch layers over them during production as these QR codes can be scanned only one time and becomes unusable as soon as anyone scans it. Therefore, the items are sent through a cover applicator, which treats the printed QR code with a concealing coating which is usually made of UV or Latex ink to make it scratch able.\nThe OTR code is duplicity proof  unlike other identification number such as bar codes which are copied by counterfeiters easily to make their fake goods valid, a in case of OTR Mark their can only be one unique item corresponding to one unique QR code in market, copying it will make the item with duplicate OTR mark invalid by the online verification system.\nThis simple process of just adding a concealed one-time-response code on items will give buyers the ultimate power to check for genuine and counterfeit goods by secure online verification system that holds the record of every genuine product present in market. Buyers after purchase can scratch and scan the QR code on the item to check whether the item is genuine or not. As the QR code is only one time scannable it will ensure that not more than one item in market with the same QR code will be legit. Buyers can confidently buy the items by checking for scratch layer which if tempered or removed means that the item is subject to counterfeiting. Buyers will be able to verify genuineness of any item by using any smartphone from anywhere around the world.\nIn case a fake item is detected or same QR code scanned multiple times a counterfeit concern will be raised and reported to respective brand with the details of the item and the place of scanning. \nThe OTR code system apart from checking genuineness provides an integrated system to gain insight on the market patterns. Brands will be able to track whether their products are reaching the region they are meant for and are not illegally traded outside the targeted market. The details about the place of QR code scanning will also be appended to the block chain respectively thereby generating a track record of every item sold in the market.\n\nThis simple yet powerful standard of quality verification can help businesses to take on the counterfeiters and deliver genuine products to consumers. Business delivering high quality specialized parts like automotive parts, electronic industry will be benefited the most as this system will present a closed end to end verification system to make trusted delivery of products.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1506","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RlilPM6Vlc0\/hqdefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"RlilPM6Vlc0","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":90967,"name":"Dipesh Narwat","country":"India"},{"id":90968,"name":"Aakash Bhadana","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":217,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 17:41:44"},{"id":929,"title":"Tripartite","description":"Increasing the level of cleanliness on campus while providing 3-sided benefits.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/929","video_thumbnail":"","youtube_video_id":"FbVXKOBHuTg","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"tr","name":"Turkey","nameNative":"T\u00fcrkiye"},"users":[{"id":2531,"name":"Semih \u00c7atalkaya","country":"Turkey"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"name":"global.videotag.sanitation","xivado_tag_id":"#Sanitation"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":15,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 22:02:31"},{"id":1667,"title":"OptiLearn","description":"It\u0027s no secret that each person learns better in their own way, making it so that the content provided by your Graduation is not always aligned with your way of studying.

In addition, this app will allow the prediction of university student group hotspots.\n\nPersonal: Students with mental health issues will be able to securely connect with other helper students and even health professionals without the fear of having to reveal their identity if they are uncomfortable. This is still a challenge even though the universities try to take measures in protecting students\u2019 identities. With proper connectivity between peers\/classmates\/friends, time management will be much easier for students, especially during exams. They can form closed study groups in a secure manner if they want to. This app will also enable organizing small-scale competitions among students. For example, they will be able to plug in certain gamification task to increase their productivity.\n\nIdentity: Students will have unique digital identities that will be governed by the decentralized blockchain network. This will lead to proper access and execution of various services that need secure access and anonymity. For example, students will be able to cast their votes (say during an interim election) online where the votes will not be linked to their actual user\/student IDs but to random public IP addresses that they will be assigned to during the event.\nThe identity aspect of this d-App will also lead to providing capabilities for further services such as attendance tracking, tracking and evacuation process during emergencies and access to secure locations within the university perimeter with less overhead for the university\u2019s security administration.\n\nThis is an all-in-one mobile application that will provide more secure and efficient ways for university students, educators, alumni and the administration to connect with each other and receive\/provide services. Overall, this will be entire the university life at everyone\u2019s fingertips.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1712","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vTLcqFgLUHs\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"vTLcqFgLUHs","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":111721,"name":"Rishabh Chakrabarty","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":54,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/29 11:17:29"},{"id":727,"title":"Anatomy lessons improvement","description":"To make process of anatomy studying more interactive and effective using visualization techniques and specific programs.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/727","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4n5Osg-aqQo\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"4n5Osg-aqQo","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2235,"name":"Sofiia Fostiak","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 15:42:19"},{"id":556,"title":"Learn It!","description":"Our application contains multiple functional parts that help students through their lectures.

We believe that we can solve this issue by digitising it. The system is automated to a great extent by the use of a card which contains a chip. The counterperson is given a card reader. Whenever customers have to make a purchase, all they need to do is place that card on the reader. This initializes the system to open that particular account after which the counterperson feeds in the code for items purchased. The transaction is completed and the amount of purchase is added to the card holder\u0027s monthly account. This is followed by a notification in an smartphone application we plan to make for the user. Thus, through complete transparency we aim to eliminate losses in money occurring due to human because of entirely manual bill-entry process.

E com isso, poderia ter como uma segunda consequ\u00eancia um aumento da seguran\u00e7a nas universidades p\u00fablicas ainda mais a noite.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1079","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4OPxN1Nk2lA\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"4OPxN1Nk2lA","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"br","name":"Brazil","nameNative":"Brasil"},"users":[{"id":35482,"name":"DRAGON ARTS","country":"Brazil"},{"id":35483,"name":"Guilherme Zelante","country":"Brazil"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"},{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":77,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/25 19:43:25"},{"id":1459,"title":"Vac.U.Up","description":"A cleaning solution for all common areas to ensure that students have a clean working environment.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1459","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SJP4znagMeE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"SJP4znagMeE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ca","name":"Canada","nameNative":"Canada"},"users":[{"id":63998,"name":"Rocco Lee","country":"Canada"},{"id":64026,"name":"Nicholas Ng","country":"Canada"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"name":"global.videotag.sanitation","xivado_tag_id":"#Sanitation"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":5,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 16:47:41"},{"id":416,"title":"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u041c\u0413\u0421\u0423","description":"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/416","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FCMYvn3p__4\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"FCMYvn3p__4","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ru","name":"Russian Federation","nameNative":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f"},"users":[{"id":1836,"name":"\u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0430","country":"Russian Federation"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"name":"global.videotag.sanitation","xivado_tag_id":"#Sanitation"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 14:30:17"},{"id":880,"title":"Available sport","description":"purchase of sports equipment","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/880","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SCvL4wvm-zg\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"SCvL4wvm-zg","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2462,"name":"Tolik Koleso","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 20:52:33"},{"id":219,"title":"Alinguo","description":"Alinguo will be a plataform where people can practice their english translating parts of various academic papers.

In my university, there are public drinking spaces. But only few students actually use them because many students feel worried about using them.

This has been made possible by invention made by us , which is an device ( Described more in the video ) which when installed under the road produces electricity when cars passes on top of it. The produced electrical energy has an power varying from 1 KW -10 KW, which is produced from an area of 1 metre square of the road!. Therefore from this invention we can develop green energy infrastructure for the traffic systems. This involves storing the produced energy in daylight when traffic movements are at the peaks, therefore the energy stored during daytime can be released into the street lights at night, according to our calculation 10 KW of stored energy from an small area of road can be enough to power up 40 street lights. The produced energy can also be used to supply power to charging stations for electric vehicles!, as some developing countries cannot afford to install charging stations because they cannot afford to produce enough electricity from  power plants, therefore there are no electric vehicles on road , which causes rise of pollution levels, which has affected cities like Delhi , Shanghai, Beijing , by using our device people will start purchasing electric vehicles as the electricity used for charging wont be expensive and therefore will decrease the pollution levels to a great extent.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1292","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mBtajWCSPk0\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"mBtajWCSPk0","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":61250,"name":"Nisha Singh","country":"India"},{"id":61251,"name":"Rahul Singh","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 08:57:50"},{"id":1465,"title":"Bolty","description":"A portable battery back a wifi router that will protect students from an internet or power outtage.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1465","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DELlchL7YfU\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"DELlchL7YfU","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":87657,"name":"Bongz Mgz","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":3,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 16:55:37"},{"id":297,"title":"University project","description":"Hi,my name is Maksim,and I want to create new university building","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/297","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/w-GFkCLRKlQ\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"w-GFkCLRKlQ","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1687,"name":"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0410\u0432\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0432","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/19 09:30:06"},{"id":474,"title":"The cradle of innovation","description":"Our project will give an opportunity to realize innovative ideas and to create prototypes for scientific investigations and startups.

Umbrella stands will be installed where students always pass on campus. Students can rent an umbrella by holding their student ID card over the sensor to unlock the umbrella stand (rental \/ return spot). Also, you cannot borrow the next umbrella until you return the borrowed umbrella. Inside the umbrella are university-related advertisements (classes and events, nearby restaurants) and student reviews.\nPreviously attached eight umbrella stands and advertisements as prototypes on campus\nAfter installing 120 rental umbrellas, I realized that theft and loss were the challenges. So, by using technology that can recognize each umbrella, we will make it clear by recognizing the student ID card when borrowing the lost umbrella. The return rate will be increased by installing umbrella stands at all the entrances of the university and at the key points where many students will pass.\nAt Wakayama University, you can often see students running in the rain after lunch break or after school. This is because in universities, you only need to put an umbrella when moving from each faculty building to a cafeteria or from a library to a bus stop. Because it \u2019s cumbersome to carry an umbrella all day long for that short distance. So I think there are student needs. In the questionnaire after the prototype started, 92% of respondents answered \u201cI want this service to continue in the future\u201d. So mind ten will definitely change our campus life positively.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1316","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LiqgjOlHzaQ\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"LiqgjOlHzaQ","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"jp","name":"Japan","nameNative":"\u65e5\u672c"},"users":[{"id":69809,"name":"K\u0026T E\u0026K","country":"Japan"},{"id":69810,"name":"Taisei Kawakami","country":"Japan"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":56,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 10:21:00"},{"id":649,"title":"E-Hub | UET Lahore","description":"Our Motto:\nDearth of resources must not cause demise of dreams.\nProblem:\nPursuit of dreams leads to development and unfortunate it is that lack of adequate machinery (investment, faculty, apparatus and equipment) clogs the process of growth. Students, specifically, find it arduous to keep up with the rapid pace of the ever evolving world despite having the potential and ideas to change things. Rusty it is for an engine that the mileage it can ran to is decreased because the components weren\u2019t oiled.\nWhat IF?? :\nWhat if we have an Elon Musk within us who has the potential to conquer the space but is out of the race because he isn\u2019t equipped? A Bill Gates or a Mark Zuckerberg. We don\u2019t want it to happen especially to students who belong to countries which have an unstable economy. They should get an equal shot at their targets too. Students can use a ladder to leave behind a better world in which they were born, to when they die. Let\u2019s find a way to supply black gold that helps people objectify their hidden glint, until a sun is made out of speck.\nSolution:\nWe present a platform, a platform where people can use others resources (within several limits and policies).

As a result, the level of students dissatisfaction with high education is extremely high. They are unmotivated to study, as they can\u2019t see any prospects.\n\n\tTo cope with this problem we have a strong desire to create an online system that will kill two birds with one stone by bringing up business and students together. Overall, the system crux is quite simple: students describe their sphere of interests and direction they would like to evolve in. Companies submit the application with descriptions of their problem and students, required for its solution. And we develop an algorithm, based on Machine Learning and AI technologies, to help business and students find each other at the highest level of efficiency.\n\nWhy companies will be interested in this project? Constant innovations - that\u2019s the only way business may keep head above the water and supersede rivals. \tFrequent are situations when innovations require scientific research or a company may look for new approaches and inspiration to solve some substantial problems. And an efficient and relatively low-cost idea is to involve students to carry their research, that solves the problem,  in cooperation with business. Students fresh minds may develop an unexpectedly new and good insight into the problem, and even in case the research results may be negative, companies may employ these already experienced students after their graduation.\n\nWhy students will be interested in this project? As it was said there are lots of students searching for the way to apply the knowledge they have already gained to solve some practical and useful problem. And our system will provide for thousands of such students an unprecedented opportunity to develop a solution to a real-life business problem. This is where they would deepen knowledge and skills in the beloved sphere, cooperate with other teammate students from other specialities, receive feedback from company specialists, write scientific articles or\/and thesis based on the research results. \n\nOverall, we greatly expect our system to integrate business with education, increase students motivation in studying and happiness, cooperation and practical experience, create overall push in innovations in Ukraine.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/559","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s1ID3pF5qVM\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"s1ID3pF5qVM","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2011,"name":"\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440 \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439","country":"Ukraine"},{"id":2012,"name":"\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":891,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 21:08:03"},{"id":1331,"title":"Siza- WhatsApp Service","description":"The idea is create a Q and A platform of university students to help incoming students either in grade 12 or those who want to get information about university, too often we see students who live in the rural parts of south Africa struggling to get information related to courses available at universities lived experiences by students who come from the same background as they do, because universities filter these to make the university look favourable so Siza is trying to resolve these issues by getting those who are already at university to help those that want to come to varsity by providing necessary information and a q and a type","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1331","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/826188233_640x360.jpg?r=pad","youtube_video_id":null,"vimeo_video_id":"369285528","country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":70510,"name":"Sphamandla Mjoli","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 10:48:37"},{"id":538,"title":"ortime","description":"OrTime is a kind of food order application\nthe application, which is valid in universities,students can order without going to the cafeterias\nin this way, students will not have to wait for their order.they will be able to take their orders quickly and warmly\nthis is the time we give them.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/538","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NvJUo9Y3RjA\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"NvJUo9Y3RjA","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"tr","name":"Turkey","nameNative":"T\u00fcrkiye"},"users":[{"id":1987,"name":"Batuhan YILDIRIM","country":"Turkey"},{"id":1988,"name":"Melih Can Erciyas","country":"Turkey"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":182,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 20:30:44"},{"id":882,"title":"new windows","description":"new windows","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/882","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gb1fxmHVV4E\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Gb1fxmHVV4E","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2466,"name":"ilya \u0420\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043d","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 20:58:00"},{"id":673,"title":"\u0022Is this your City\u0022 ecobonuses program","description":"This bonuses program gives students and all people gifts and discounts for ecological life. \nPrinciple of work program for participants:\n1.

In Ukraine, there is a big problem in a large number of students who are not studying in their field and do not know who they want to be. In this way, I think that many of students will have motivation to study in their specialty. The idea is to make a system of accumulating points in subjects. There will be phone application in which the elders will celebrate those present and the teachers will put points. Will be a list of students by balls will be compiled. At the end of the academic year, cumulative points can be exchanged for some thing. For example, high points on physical trains is a good discount on new sneakers. And who has the highest score on the year gets sneakers. The same pattern applies to other subjects. The best students will receive books, concert tickets, sports equipment and much more. Whoever gets the highest score at the university will get a free trip to Europe for 2 days. This will cost universities cheaply, but in this way we motivate students to study where they are interested.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/150","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/821240662_640x360.jpg?r=pad","youtube_video_id":null,"vimeo_video_id":"365484020","country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1217,"name":"Ruslan Garbuz","country":"Ukraine"},{"id":1218,"name":"Ruslan Garbuz","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/10 09:54:24"},{"id":499,"title":"Bookcrossing system for self-development","description":"I suggest running a bookcrossing system, but not a usual one. \nThere will be a book station in each dormitory and academic building, and, according to the principle of bookcrossing, anyone can pick up a book and anyone can leave a book. \nBut the difference is that there will be created a telegram bot and any student will be able to join.\n\nThere will be several functions in the bot. \nSuch as \u0022Update book availability\u0022 where a person gets points for information about available books at a particular station.

They can still maintain their anonymity if they choose to. \nThis can eventually lead to people meeting physically and talking about their problems like in a support group.\nThe idea is still in its infancy, but we feel Red Bull can provide us with the push we need to refine it, and improve lives of students.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/861","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W4mRVo1XBeM\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"W4mRVo1XBeM","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"pk","name":"Pakistan","nameNative":"Pakistan"},"users":[{"id":2432,"name":"Musharaf Tameer","country":"Pakistan"},{"id":2433,"name":"Huzefa Tahir","country":"Pakistan"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":295,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 20:22:44"},{"id":1392,"title":"Time Saver","description":"With time saver you will save time to buy drinks at your university. paying through the page and reserving what you want to take.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1392","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FnlxKPBBF8I\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"FnlxKPBBF8I","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"cl","name":"Chile","nameNative":"Chile"},"users":[{"id":74540,"name":"Valentina Juarez","country":"Chile"},{"id":74541,"name":"Kevin Parada","country":"Chile"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 13:12:36"},{"id":1638,"title":"Sistema \u00fanico para controle de energia e \u00e1gua dos banheiros","description":"Um sistema que ligue a energia e \u00e1gua de todos os banheiros da universidade, trazendo um benef\u00edcio para a institui\u00e7\u00e3o e para o pa\u00eds","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1638","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/b5ZKvr6A2ww\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"b5ZKvr6A2ww","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"br","name":"Brazil","nameNative":"Brasil"},"users":[{"id":107014,"name":"Mateus Benilton","country":"Brazil"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 21:43:59"},{"id":356,"title":"AMIGO - Student Knowledge Exchange System","description":"Amigo is a student knowledge exchange system that provides a platform that allows the students to find an amigo from their university who can help them in understanding a certain topic or learn a new skill.

On the other hand, you can search for a specific skill or topic that you want to learn and you will be shown all the people who acquire that skill and you can connect with that person. There will be an hour based credit system, each request will cost a certain amount of credits based on the number of hours requested for the meeting. When a person signs up, he\/she will be given a fixed amount of credits and then earn or spend the credits by accepting or placing requests.

We want to help students on forgein campuses to immediatly be able to orientate themselves and connect with others to know where to go and that without problematic language barriers or difficult explanations. Just like real bridge languages we build our idea on the students themselves and their knowledge. We want enable them to translate the sings on campus in real time and find useful and interresting information left by other students to better find their way in their new envriourment. Unlike other AR(augmented reality) technology on the market right now however we will take advantage of our unique ablity to crowdsource information and apply AR imaging technology to avoid the usual issues that would occour when using for example google lens for such a task. Here is an example: Let\u0027s say an reccent exchange student from Beijing is studying in Cairo and is looking for the cafeteria he might still have some issues with the signs which could cost him valueable eating time (and we simply can\u0027t have that!). With Bridge lens AR he could simply open the app and have the signs guiding him there translated for him in real time and he could also find useful information there left by other students around campus in his language, it could be recommendations on what to eat or events that might happen in the cafeteria in the next week. With all this information he can find his way on campus quicker and hopfully also find his way into the community there far more easily and natrually.

So why not we rely completely on libraries!!\n\nUnfortunately our library does not contain enough books for all the students,  there are only a few number  of copies available, which eventually vanishes in the first week of the semester. This problem reverberates for almost all the colleges that come under our university.\n\nLast year we observed that most of our seniors while vacating the hostel left their books and notes for scrap dealers.It was a huge heap of books and none of the juniors were willing enough to dive in and find the books they need for the upcoming semesters. So those books went directly to the scrap. To solve this problem, we came up with an idea, that is an app that would help to communicate between the two parties, one who needs the book and the other who wants to get rid of the book. So this is how it works.\n\nOnce you post the name of the book you need, the app would notify all the users in the college. The one who has it will reply to you.\n In the profile ID, the giver can put on the names of the books that they have. So that if some one searches for a book, the profile would automatically pop up.\n Another feature is the ability to lend books for a specific time.   In this way, we can not only share books but also, notes, eBooks, question papers, etc. So basically the app aims at sharing study materials among the students of the same college","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1410","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g_MuYmLtvtw\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"g_MuYmLtvtw","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":41767,"name":"Vinla Rose PORUTHUR VINCEN","country":"India"},{"id":79687,"name":"MOHAMED NADEEM","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":44,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 14:23:36"},{"id":267,"title":"\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435","description":"\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043e\u0432","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/267","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Wgwb6t2ok4g\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Wgwb6t2ok4g","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":1640,"name":"\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0411\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0443\u043d","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/18 15:36:58"},{"id":349,"title":"Pulse","description":"No one is safe from accidents.

In this part we plan to design a bot, an AI companion for the young kid. This bot will aid the kid throughout his primary and junior academic life, by teaching and introducing the concepts to be taught in a fun manner.\nBoth would work on a reward\/incentive-based learning curve, i.e. to start with only a handful of modules would be available to the kid and depending on how fast the kid courses through them would directly affect the unlocking of newer and more challenging modules.\n \nObjective\nThe objective of the robot is simple, \u2018MAKE LEARNING FUN\u2019. The robot would come equipped with a variety of modules. The order in which modules will be available for kids to explore would be based on the pace of learning of the kid and would not restrict them to complete the modules in a given time frame.\nOn the surface it might seem like, that there is only the benefit of \u2018interest and incentive driven learning\u2019, but it also has another very important benefit, if a kid happens to be stuck on a module for too long, then we can escalate the issue to parents\/teachers which can help in determining whether the kid has any special educational requirements or not. We believe this to be a very important feature, because it\u2019s always challenging for kids to express their problems, especially ones that are affecting them from within.\n \n\nTarget Audience\nOne thing to note is that the bot is not being marketed to homes or the general public. It would instead be marketed to schools and other similar institutions as an educational aid that would be used in classes and labs.\nWe have taken this decision, because this would be a costly purchase for an avg. customer, and it would be a really huge challenge for us to provide service to the general population. There are only 1.5 million schools in India but there are over a billion people in India, thus it is wiser for us to target the schools instead of targeting the people individually. Targeting the schools would also help us generate a new revenue stream, of providing service and maintenance for the bot to schools.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1710","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oa9Up_QCfEs\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"oa9Up_QCfEs","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":111481,"name":"rohan mujoo","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":41,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 22:59:29"},{"id":500,"title":"StuStore","description":"It\u0027s an application which helps the students since it provides the students discounts and offers on the products they need and help them by exchanging things they don\u0027t need with things they need","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/500","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r0gcm24xPZE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"r0gcm24xPZE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"eg","name":"Egypt","nameNative":"\u0645\u0635\u0631\u200e"},"users":[{"id":1944,"name":"Ali El Hanafy","country":"Egypt"},{"id":1945,"name":"Abdallah Atrees OFFICIAL","country":"Egypt"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":63,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 19:07:39"},{"id":1702,"title":"EZTutor","description":"EZtutor is a platform where tutors are able to work flexible hours, build meaningful relationships, and earn money through education rather than a laborious minimum wage job.

The drones collect video information on the perpetrator and pass it on to authorities.\n\nSouth Africa ranks amongst the worst countries in the world for criminal activity. Known as the rape capital of the world, walking in and around University campuses is a dangerous activity, particularly for people on their own. The past few months have seen enormous student protests against gender-based violence and this served as the source of inspiration for our product. University campuses should be a place of safety and confidence in your surroundings, something we are seeking to achieve and promote. \n\nWhen an individual - particularly one walking on impoverished roads around South African university campuses - feels threatened, they can press their panic button via the Automata app (app downloadable at https:\/\/tg4aw.glideapp.io ), calling for drone assistance. The drone will then fly to the location \u0026 use image detection to detect irregular\/violent behaviour. The image detection allows the drone to temporarily follow the perpetrator, increasing chances of apprehension. \n\nTo demonstrate our ability to execute our vision, we have built a prototype using a Tello Ryze Drone. We have:\n- Built the emergency app (download link mentioned above). \n - Connected to the Tello Drone with Python, controlling the Tello from our computers.\n - Developed a face detection algorithm that renders through the Tello camera. \n - Used the face detection input to render flight decisions, providing basic \u201cfollow me\u201d commands. \n\nIf we are accepted, our goals for the competition are: \nDevelope a fully autonomous drone that renders dynamic flight decisions based on computer vision, lidar, GPS \u0026 app communication (call for assist). Further, error catching methods will need to be designed and engineered as autonomously navigating urban settings may become dangerous.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1395","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gelvljsPbgs\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"gelvljsPbgs","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":2097,"name":"Zach Wolpe","country":"South Africa"},{"id":75494,"name":"Keagan Stokoe","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":273,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 13:25:43"},{"id":1439,"title":"Rise App (Mental Health)","description":"The Rise App tackles mental health by facilitating communication between students and on-campus councillors. \nSchools are already paying for councillors, we aim to maximize their impact. \nHelp us help others, vote for the Rise App.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1439","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nDCZi_SOeDg\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"nDCZi_SOeDg","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ie","name":"Ireland","nameNative":"\u00c9ire"},"users":[{"id":1248,"name":"Muhammad Ahmad Pasha","country":"Ireland"},{"id":1252,"name":"Muhammad Hamza Pasha","country":"Ireland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":134,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 15:53:54"},{"id":449,"title":"University Social","description":"There is lack of communication between students in university campuses.

The App fosters integration between public transport services and university transport services. From the app students are able to get the driver\u2019s identity  and  the vehicle description in which they are boarded in. This information will come handy if they want to rate the driver or if they lose an item in a bus they will know which bus they were boarded on respectively.  \n ITranz moves will allow the driver to push in notifications to students in case there is a breakdown or anything that affects shuttle service operations and students not wait for buses that will not arrive and thus can use alternative means of transportation all this happens in real time. iTranz will enable students to plan their trips in real time and thus reducing the time they will spend at bus stops this will also increase safety as they not spend time at bus stops e.g. when it\u2019s at night. Students will approach bus stops when their bus is also approaching and meanwhile they can be focusing on  school work  in safe areas without being worried of being left behind. The integration with public transport allows students to plan their trips for both public and university transport in cases the student does not stay on campus. This idea also create a link between the university and the city transport and thus it can be used in the university and outside university. In which the community is also benefited. \n\nThere is currently working demo of the application we hope the red bull opportunity helps us further develop this idea.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1523","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NwvwabYZkAE\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"NwvwabYZkAE","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"za","name":"South Africa","nameNative":"South Africa"},"users":[{"id":93351,"name":"Nhlanhla Simphiwe Sithebe","country":"South Africa"},{"id":93357,"name":"Brendon Dube","country":"South Africa"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":6,"name":"global.videotag.security","xivado_tag_id":"#Security"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":159,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/28 18:18:10"},{"id":721,"title":"Bio toilet","description":"My idea for cleaning party near our hostel","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/721","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKbxFvBes5A\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"fKbxFvBes5A","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2230,"name":"Alice Danilovich","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":0,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 15:22:20"},{"id":1243,"title":"ZULU: Projects made easier","description":"A major problem faced by technical students in large campuses is to find the perfect partners for their projects.

Students create profiles on ZULU based on their educational qualifications, research backgrounds, fields of interest, honors and awards, etc. Once the profile is ready the user can browse through openings available in project teams in the college. If an interesting project is found, ZULU allows the user to send a notification of interest. ZULU allows team leaders to view through the profile of the interested candidate and initiate a talk to make sure the right person is onboard to the team!\nZULU allows forum talks where users can post queries. For example, queries related to the availability of a component, queries regarding projects, etc. This allows users to share and support each other.\nYet another feature of ZULU is to manage projects. Once users form the team, ZULU would enable them to keep a track of the completion of the project. This makes life easier for the leader and also makes each other responsible.\nZULU is extremely effective in large universities where students are not aware of the kind of talent pool they have in their college and end up being teammates with mediocre members. \nZULU would help teams to:\n1.\tBecome more productive with less stress\n2.\tBlend complementary strengths\n3.\tCreate an opportunity to learn from one another\n4.\tTurn ideas into successful start-ups","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/1243","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ovLz_CZ9V-E\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"ovLz_CZ9V-E","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"in","name":"India","nameNative":"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924"},"users":[{"id":9466,"name":"Rohith Mathew","country":"India"},{"id":60697,"name":"Hisham Sherief","country":"India"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":66,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/27 20:17:51"},{"id":1556,"title":"Triend - Sustainability Options","description":"The idea is to develop a system that will allow students and university members to make the right discard to the residues they produce in the university and in their homes, by making the university a collecting point.

At the moment, the current parking situation has lead to a survival of the fittest mindset which has lead to a culture of strife and aggression in the parking garages on campus. It can sometimes take up to 30 minutes or more to find a spot, and although park and ride is an option, it\u0027s not ideal if you have a class to get to and you know that it is going to take 15-25 minutes to get ferried in from a lot on the outskirts of campus. So usually it\u0027s worth it to gamble and try for a spot in the garage, but you have deal with the difficulty of finding a spot and hope you find someone leaving. That\u0027s where my solution comes in. I propose a type of check in, check out system that connects people leaving campus with incoming students. It will be based on a priority system of when your class time is or if you are just studying. This project would encourage a culture of fairness and civility surrounding parking, unlike the parking system now which creates strife and animosity.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/193","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DZ3kiTWDyCw\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"DZ3kiTWDyCw","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"us","name":"United States","nameNative":"United States"},"users":[{"id":1326,"name":"Hanna Quinn","country":"United States"},{"id":1327,"name":"Siying Yu","country":"United States"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":22,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/16 13:08:52"},{"id":623,"title":"Quality education","description":"We seek to integrate the education system with technology to make the system more efficient by use of an application which is students,instructor and institution oriented","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/623","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7HXDFLmH6Z4\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"7HXDFLmH6Z4","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ke","name":"Kenya","nameNative":"Kenya"},"users":[{"id":2106,"name":"Caroline Mwangi","country":"Kenya"},{"id":2107,"name":"Ian Njore","country":"Kenya"}],"tags":[],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1810,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 07:58:35"},{"id":697,"title":"\u042d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432","description":"\u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0443, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/697","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R9zoCgqh9yY\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"R9zoCgqh9yY","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ua","name":"Ukraine","nameNative":"\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430"},"users":[{"id":2198,"name":"\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0423\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430","country":"Ukraine"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":7,"name":"global.videotag.other","xivado_tag_id":"#Other"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":2,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 13:34:46"},{"id":843,"title":"Dr. med.","description":"The Challenge: Mental balance is a prerequisite for our quality of life and good relationships. Disbalance leads to bio-psycho-social problems and thus mental disorders. These manifests themselves as anxiety, depression, ad-diction, etc. with subsequent loss of status and social isolation. One in three people suffer from a mental disorder once or several times in the course of their lives. Over 12 months, 17.6% of the world\u0027s population experience a mental disorder, equivalent to 1.4 billion affected individuals worldwide. The diagnosis of work- and stress-related disorders is gaining ground in all developed countries. These cause considerable health costs and up to 40% malfunctions of workforces. Moreover, half of those affected have no access to therapy.\n\nOur approach: Prevention, treatment, and cure of mental disorders is our vision. To this end, we are creating the virtual Institute for Mental Health (v-IFMH), a digital ecosystem, with 2- and 3-dimensionally usable education, assessment and therapy solutions. \u201cHYGGII\u201d THE THERAPIST IN YOUR POCKET allows the clients to access an artificial intelligence (AI) powered chatbot offering first assistance and personalised solutions. New technolo-gies such as virtual reality (VR), brain-computer interfaces (neurofeedback, e.g.), bio-signal monitoring and bi-omarker diagnostics and therapeutic gaming offer revolutionary new ways to promote and train the brain in terms of behavioural change and balance. Additionally, a partner community of health service providers is connected. In this way, we offer a low-threshold, anonymous access, promote self-help, strengthen health competence and adherence to therapy programs. With that we close an important gap in mental health care. The evidence of the therapy can be provided scientifically on an ongoing basis, taking digitalization into account. \n\nFinancial requirements for the implementation: A first round of financing of CHF 300,000 led to the develop-ment of the idea, the first proof-of-concepts. Partners from Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Israel, the USA and China have contributed with conviction. For the first release with novel elements of virtual reality, and artificial intelligence, the IFMH requires 2 million CHF in two tranches. Health service providers (hospitals, psychia-trists, therapists and coaches) support early financing and contribute to the high professional acceptance of the v-IFMH through expert-cantered design. This minimizes the risks for the second financing round (venture capital and private equity) and makes this ambitious \u0022game changer\u0022 possible. \nHYGGii has recently been supported with 50\u0027000 \u20ac SME StartUp funding by the European Commission under the Horizon2020 programme.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/843","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zh120pvQWSQ\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"Zh120pvQWSQ","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"ch","name":"Switzerland","nameNative":"Schweiz"},"users":[{"id":2406,"name":"Andrea Degen","country":"Switzerland"},{"id":2407,"name":"Etienne Heitz","country":"Switzerland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":3,"name":"global.videotag.empowerment","xivado_tag_id":"#Empowerment"}],"is_finalist":false,"vote_count":1,"voting_open":true,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 19:48:54"},{"id":1207,"title":"Next Level","description":"A platform that matches students to internship opportunities based on company and student interests.

Or maybe scan the QR code label of a used book from the university\u0027s dedicated Scan Go book shelf and the funds are transferred to the original owner of the book, making book trading easier and faster.","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/603","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lTL4bA0t1gc\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"lTL4bA0t1gc","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"eg","name":"Egypt","nameNative":"\u0645\u0635\u0631\u200e"},"users":[{"id":2070,"name":"Sherif Ashraf","country":"Egypt"},{"id":2071,"name":"Tarek Reda","country":"Egypt"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":true,"vote_count":2379,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 00:37:09"},{"id":803,"title":"Student Assistant Bot (SAB.)","description":"How many times have you forgot about a due date? Or went all the way to a lecture hall only to find out the lecture\u0027s cancelled? \nHow many times have you wished you could hitch a ride to\/from campus or between buildings just to avoid those excruciatingly long, boring journeys?\nWho in the world is that guy in the white shirt and where can I get one?\nWell, not everyone could dress a genie like a nerd. But why would you need to sneak a genie onto campus when you can squeeze one right into your phone?\n\nThe Zewail City Student Union knows how desperately we all long for someone like that guy in white, so we present you with the SAB application which allows you to;\n1)Book rooms and lecture halls for student activities\n2)Directly contact emergency services, such as the health care unit and security department \n3)Book courts (football, basketball, etc.) for sports events \nNot only that, but the application also provides students with a detailed map to all the lecture halls, staff offices and departments, along with all the bus routes, timetables and pickup and drop off points. \nThe SAB likes to go the extra mile so for the cherry on top, we would like to introduce \u0027campooling\u0027, the on campus carpooling service. Share the long journeys to, from and inside campus with other members of your community and add just a tad of merriness to those otherwise tiresome journeys. While still on the carpooling thing, in exchange for every person you choose to give a ride, you get awarding credit. That, and any other service you provide for or value you add to your community, is rewarded. This credit is to mimic real-life currency that can be used for transactions on campus so that you\u0027re never out of cash!","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/803","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bPzUudrSQEA\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"bPzUudrSQEA","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"eg","name":"Egypt","nameNative":"\u0645\u0635\u0631\u200e"},"users":[{"id":2335,"name":"Abdelrahman Kotb","country":"Egypt"},{"id":2336,"name":"Ahmed Awad","country":"Egypt"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"global.videotag.accessibility","xivado_tag_id":"#Accessibility"},{"id":2,"name":"global.videotag.inclusion","xivado_tag_id":"#Inclusion"}],"is_finalist":true,"vote_count":1277,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/21 18:56:42"},{"id":408,"title":"Red Bull Basement University : Book Station - Jamie\u0026Duck","description":"\u201cBookstation\u201d\uff0c\u50cf\u662f\u500b\u884c\u52d5\u7684\u5716\u66f8\u5546\u4eba\u6563\u5e03\u5728\u6821\u5712\u7684\u5404\u500b\u89d2\u843d\n\u5de6\u908a\u662f\u820a\u66f8\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5373\u5c07\u7562\u696d\u7684\u5927\u5b78\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u904e\u591a\u7684\u66f8\u7c4d\u589e\u52a0\u4f60\u642c\u5bb6\u7684\u8ca0\u64d4\u3002\u4f60\u4e5f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8a72\u5982\u4f55\u8655\u7406\u9019\u4e9b\u820a\u66f8\u3002\u800cBookstation\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f60\u8ce3\u66f8\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6f02\u4eae\u5730\u5c07\u820a\u66f8\u653e\u5165Bookstation\u7684\u5c55\u793a\u6ac3\uff0c\u55ef...\u6211\u5011\u6703\u82b1\u4e00\u9ede\u6642\u9593\u5e6b\u4f60\u7684\u66f8\u505a\u6bba\u83cc\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u5df1\u6c7a\u5b9a\u8981\u8ca9\u8ce3\u7684\u50f9\u683c\uff0c\u4f46\u904e\u9ad8\u7684\u50f9\u683c\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u7121\u6cd5\u5e6b\u52a9\u4f60\u8ce3\u66f8...\u3002\u800c\u73fe\u5728\u6b63\u6709\u4e00\u4f4d\u9700\u8981\u9019\u672c\u66f8\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u9ede\u9078\u4f60\u525b\u525b\u653e\u7f6e\u5c55\u793a\u6ac3\u7684\u865f\u78bc\uff0c\u4ed6\u6295\u5165\u4e86\u4f60\u525b\u525b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7684\u91d1\u984d\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u6703\u7acb\u523b\u767c\u8a0a\u606f\u901a\u77e5\u4f60\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u7b46\u9322\u6703\u900f\u904e\u4f60\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a\uff0c\u81ea\u52d5\u8f49\u5165\u4f60\u7684\u9280\u884c\u3002\u4f46...\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7684\u66f8\u4e00\u76f4\u8ce3\u4e0d\u6389\uff0c\u4e03\u5929\u5f8c\u6211\u5011\u6703\u5c07\u9019\u4e9b\u66f8\u6350\u51fa\u53bb\u3002\u7576\u7136\u6703\u5728\u5230\u671f\u7684\u524d\u4e00\u5929\u901a\u77e5\u4f60\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9078\u64c7\u5c07\u4f60\u7684\u66f8\u62ff\u56de\u4f86\uff0c\u6216\u662f..\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u6350\u51fa\u53bb\u3002\nBookstation\u53f3\u908a\u4e5f\u6709\u6eff\u6eff\u65b0\u66f8\u7684\u9801\u9762\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8cfc\u8cb7\u76ee\u524dBookstation\u6709\u7684\u65b0\u66f8\n\u6700\u7279\u5225\u7684\u662f\uff0cBookstation\u6709\u500b\u8a31\u9858\u6c60\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8a31\u4e0b\u4f60\u7684\u9858\u671b\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u9858\u671b\u7684\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8a31\u9858\u6c60\u4e2d\u5e6b\u4f60\u6309\u500b\u611b\u5fc3\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u672c\u66f8\u7d2f\u7a4d\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u611b\u5fc3\uff0cBookstation\u5c31\u6703\u52d5\u52d5\u4ed6\u7684\u96d9\u817f\u53bb\u5e6b\u4f60\u5be6\u73fe\u4f60\u7684\u9858\u671b\u5466\uff01","detail_link":"\/global-en\/project\/408","video_thumbnail":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oZcPrz0OxS4\/sddefault.jpg","youtube_video_id":"oZcPrz0OxS4","vimeo_video_id":null,"country":{"code":"tw","name":"Taiwan","nameNative":"\u81fa\u7063"},"users":[{"id":1825,"name":"\u627f\u54f2 \u8521","country":"Taiwan"},{"id":1826,"name":"\u70b3\u8fb0 \u6797","country":"Taiwan"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"name":"global.videotag.sustainability","xivado_tag_id":"#Sustainability"}],"is_finalist":true,"vote_count":103,"voting_open":false,"created_at":"2019\/10\/20 13:33:43"},{"id":857,"title":"Trapezna App","description":"The idea is to create an app that can provide an online queue and online order of the canteen.
